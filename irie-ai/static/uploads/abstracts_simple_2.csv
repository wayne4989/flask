,9455186,"Program Director/Principal Investigator (Last, First, Middle): Project Summary/Abstract This project will explore calcium-release-activated calcium channels (CRAC) as a potential therapeutic target in a laboratory stroke model. Stroke is a significant health problem in developed nations, but definitive treatments are few, and no treatments are available which can rescue brain cells dying from ischemia. Microglia are the brain's resident immune cell, and many studies have now shown that when activated, they contribute negatively to stroke outcome. Thus, strategies to inhibit microglial functions could prove therapeutic. Recent work by other labs has focused on the role of CRAC channels in inflammatory cells such as T cells, mast cells and neutrophils, and other inflammatory conditions such as autoimmune disease and acute pancreatitis; however, very little work has been published on CRAC channels as they pertain to microglia or inflammation in the ischemic brain. Preliminary work in our lab showed that these inhibitors block microglial activation and protect the brain from experimental traumatic brain injury. This project will study novel inhibitors of CRAC channels in an in vivo model of stroke. Mice exposed to middle cerebral artery occlusion will be treated with novel CRAC channel inhibitors to see if this will improve neurological outcomes, and if this is due to an anticipated anti-inflammatory effect. This project will explore whether this compound will improve outcome in experimental stroke in both male and female animals.

,9453430,"PROJECT SUMMARY To promote smoking cessation, it is essential to promote intentions to quit smoking, as intentions are important precursors to action. The goal of this B/START award is to use ecological momentary assessment (EMA) to study fluctuations in quit motivation and perceived momentary self-regulation abilities for smokers who are not ready to attempt quitting. Burgeoning research suggests that intentions to quit may shift rapidly and subsume several different aspects of quit motivation (e.g., desire to be a non-smoker, willingness to engage in effort toward cessation). Thus far, EMA has been underutilized in studying fluctuations in motivation over time in smokers? own environments, particularly in smokers who are interested in reducing smoking but not yet ready to quit. Prior research has also established the importance of people?s perceptions of their own self-regulation abilities in predicting cessation success, such as the perceived ability to control craving, tolerate distress, or exert willpower. Yet these perceived abilities also likely vary across situations, and may vary systematically alongside quit motivation. Thus, a critical barrier to understanding quit intentions is a lack of knowledge about how underlying motivational tendencies and perceived self-regulation abilities fluctuate over time and situational context. The objective of this B/START R03 grant is to use EMA to examine fluctuations in quit motivation and perceived self-regulation abilities for smokers interested in quitting but not yet ready to quit. To accomplish this, we will (Aim 1) use EMA to assess momentary quit motivation over time, across (Aim 1a) both smoking and non-smoking contexts and (Aim 1b) evaluate how these fluctuations in motivation are associated with momentary perceived self-regulation abilities, specifically the ability to control cravings, tolerate distress and exert willpower. We will then (Aim 2) determine if fluctuations in motivation and momentary perceived self- regulation abilities predict variability in nightly quit intentions. Our central hypothesis is that contextual variability in quit motivation and momentary perceived self-regulation abilities will predict quit intentions. The proposed research is significant because evidence that quit motivation and intention varies across contexts would have the potential to advance the field in several ways, namely by providing avenues toward new behavioral intervention targets. The proposed research is innovative because it uses well-established methods for understanding dynamic processes (e.g., EMA), but is the first to apply these methods to understanding fluctuations in quit motivation and intention, in an understudied group of smokers?those who are interested in reducing smoking but not yet ready to attempt cessation. This grant will form the foundation of a series of future directions, including using the measures developed here to predict lapse following a cessation attempt, and development of ecological momentary interventions that can activate motivation to quit and encourage quit intentions by helping people manage self-regulation conflicts as they occur in daily life.", ,,,
,9401990,"Project Summary Despite significant advances in understanding immune system abnormalities associated with B-ALL, how the status of the immune system at birth contributes to leukemia development is unknown. The distinguishing feature of this application is the cellular immunity perspective from which this question is addressed. I propose that in addition to B-cell progenitor intrinsic mutagenesis, non-B lineage immune cells also play a prominent role in B-ALL development. B-cell progenitors develop mutations as a direct response to inflammatory stimuli; however, the bone marrow contains other immune cell populations that can alter tumor development in response to inflammation. For example, in solid cancers, low levels of the cytokine IL-10 elicit strong pro-tumor responses of CD8 T cells and neutrophils. Specifically, CD8 T cells lose their ability to detect and lyse tumor cells, whereas neutrophils become elevated in frequency and increase the potential for reactive-oxygen and - nitrogen species (ROS/RNS) to induce cancer-associated mutations. I hypothesize that the anti-tumor mechanisms of IL-10 in increasing CD8 T cell activity and suppressing neutrophils are involved in the protective role of IL-10 in childhood B-ALL. In addition to developing B-ALL at an accelerated rate, Il10-/- TEL- AML1 Cdkn2a-/- mice have more exhausted, PD1+ CD8 memory T cells and are also characterized by higher levels of neutrophils than Il10+/+ TEL-AML1 Ckdn2a-/- mice. Experiments in Aim 1 will extend this observation by testing the impact of Il10 loss on the cytotoxic activity of CD8 memory T cells directed to leukemic B cells and on the ability of leukemic B cells to suppress their own immunogenicity, a mechanism of immune evasion. Additional experiments will also track the extent to which the recruitment of CD8 T cells to leukemias and their subsequent cytotoxic activity requires responsiveness to IL-10. These experiments will provide a biological demonstration for how CD8 T cells can be a factor in IL-10 mediated protection in B-ALL. Studies in Aim 2 will determine if the ROS/RNS produced by neutrophils of Il10-/- TEL-AML1 Cdkn2a-/- mice induce more DNA damage in B progenitors and contribute to decreased B-ALL latency compared to Il10+/+ TEL-AML1 Ckdn2a-/- mice. Activation and ROS/RNS production will be assessed in neutrophils isolated from the Il10-/- and Il10+/+ leukemias. I will then determine how Il10 loss impacts the mutational landscape of leukemia. The expectation is that the total number of mutations and ROS/RNS-associated mutational signatures will be increased in the leukemic B cells that developed in the absence of Il10. Finally, I will determine if the elevation of neutrophils that is characterized in pre-leukemic and leukemic Il10-/- TEL-AML1 Cdkn2a-/- mice is required for the acceleration of B-ALL development. The results of the proposed research will provide new biological insights into how immune defects at birth contribute to the development of childhood B-ALL. Moreover, this work has the potential to identify immune responses that can be targeted for leukemia prevention in children at high risk for B-ALL.", ,,,
,9308968,"?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The complex of DNA, protein, and RNA known as chromatin is the substrate for essential cellular processes such as gene transcription, regulation, replication, and repair. Unravelling its structure and dynamics is therefore essential f we are to understand the mechanics of these processes and their effects in development and disease. Chromatin is, however, a difficult target to study: it is found in a crowded environment within the nucleus, is structurally organized on multiple length scales, is variable within and between nuclei, and is highly dynamic. Capturing this information requires instrumentation which can (i) measure on multiple length scales, from the whole cell down to tens of nm, (ii) follow chromatin dynamics in living cells, and (iii) acquire and quantify thousands of images in a manageable time frame to overcome the intrinsic variability and provide a statistical description of chromatin behavior. Such an instrument does not yet exist, with existing instrumentation being limited in resolution, dynamic speed, and throughput. We propose an innovative multi-disciplinary approach that combines developments in optics, data processing and modeling to realize an integrated system for automated high-throughput super- resolution imaging and dense single-molecule tracking in the cell nucleus. Our Specific Aims are: 1) Develop an automated multicolor 3D single-molecule switching (SMS) nanoscope for dynamic imaging and particle-tracking in the nucleus, 2) Develop data processing tools for high-throughput 3D- SMS nanoscopy of 100-1,000 cells/h, 3) Develop chromatin modeling tools that take advantage of the unprecedented level of detail and statistical depth of the 4D data provided by high-throughput particle- tracking and SMS nanoscopy, and 4) test the performance and refine our technical developments by applying them to a diverse set of representative and important questions in the field of chromatin architecture, including the mobility and dynamics of transcription factors and nucleosomes, and the processes of synaptonemal assembly and telomere recombination. The proposal represents a fundamental departure from the traditional view of the nanoscopy image generation procedure as a hands-on process heavily involving an expert user to an automated, high- throughput method with focus on quantification and efficiency. By making nanoscopy studies of tens of thousands of cells feasible, we anticipate that our instrument will enable, for the first time, the spatiotemporal dynamics of the nucleome to be quantitatively investigated down to the single nucleosome level.", ,,,
,9331438,"?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Our overall goal is to improve the efficiency of clinical trials of new cancer therapies by enhancing the effectiveness of quantitative PET/CT imaging of tumor response. In this renewal application, we seek to deploy and validate in multi-center clinical trials the quantitative PET imaging tools and methods that we have developed within the Quantitative Imaging Network (QIN) during the current project period. While quantitative PET imaging is a uniquely powerful tool to assess response to potential cancer therapies, it is also subject to several sources of bias and variability that degrade study power. In addition, multi-center studies are needed to increase patient accrual rates, even in early-phase studies. These multi-center studies can confound quantitative accuracy, further reducing study power, leading to missed opportunities in evaluating new therapies To accelerate the evaluation of cancer therapies using quantitative PET imaging we have three distinct and linked aims: (1) Develop and implement a unified database and imaging platform that enables feasible deployment of our phantoms and software tools. (2) Extend our quantitative FDG PET imaging tools to FLT (proliferation) and FES (receptor status) in multicenter studies. (3) Prospectively test the integration of the above tools and methods in a clinical trial that uses 18F-FES PET imaging to evaluate new breast cancer therapies. These approaches can be readily extended to other cancers using quantitative PET imaging. The prospective testing of quantitative PET imaging tools in multisite clinical trials is an essential step towards adoption. In turn this will help accelerate the effective evaluation of improved cancer therapies by quantitative imaging, which will benefit investigators, clinicians, and cancer patients.", ,,,
,9331435,"One of the starkest realities facing the contemporary research community is the paucity of experienced  investigators involved in translational pancreatic cancer research. The goal of the Career Developmental  Program (CDP) is to attract, develop, and monitor the most promising investigators for translational research  in pancreatic cancer. The CDP is targeted to both junior faculty and early mid-career faculty at any Mayo  Clinic campus who will commit to mentored career development. We have attracted and nurtured individuals  who are now committed to a pancreatic cancer research career. One of our past CDP awardees (Dr. Robert  McWilliams) has developed successfully to become a Co-leader in a full translational research project in this  current competing renewal application. The corps of senior pancreatic cancer researchers at Mayo Clinic,  combined with highly productive investigators in other areas of cancer research, form mentoring teams.  Mentoring is accompanied by close oversight by the SPORE leadership team. The Director of the CDP will  report to the SPORE Director and the SPORE Steering Committee. Mayo Clinic has, by its seamless blend  of patient care and basic and applied research facilities, an environment conducive to this type of mentored  translational research. Because Mayo Clinic is competitive in recruiting faculty, there is a continuous pool of  early but outstanding scientists and clinicians (including talented female and minority investigators) who  need an impetus such as that offered by our SPORE?s proposed CDP to engage in translational research  with a focus on pancreatic cancer. We will continue to implement our formal mechanisms for recruiting,  selecting and evaluating awardees, and will ensure that awardees are integrated into the SPORE research  environment. In all cases, we expect that recipients in the CDP will build upon the resources allocated to  them to develop independent funding in pancreatic cancer research. The explicit expectation is that the  awardees will utilize the resources made available to them for the development of independent research  programs and acquisition of independent funding in breast cancer research. One annual award for up to  $100,000 will be made ($50K from the SPORE grant, matched by Mayo Clinic Cancer Center support).", ,,,

,9344662,"Project II- Project Summary The mirror neuron system (MNS) has been hypothesized to broadly influence social cognitive development, but research has just begun to evaluate the nature and significance of these effects early in life. The proposed work in Project II seeks to elucidate the learning mechanisms that support early motor learning and social perception as well as the broader role that the MNS may play in supporting social-cognitive development. These issues are addressed in three aims, each of which involves recruiting behavioral data as well as electroencephalogram (EEG) measures of MNS function supported by Core B: Aim 1: Investigate the neural correlates and behavioral consequences of action learning in infants. Our prior results suggest that the MNS is plastic during early development, changing as a function of long-term motor experience, and that this plasticity may involve both long-term and short-term learning effects. Aim 1 investigates the neural and behavioral correlates of short- and long-term action training in order to shed light on how the processes involved in the initial stages of action learning relate to those that emerge with longer-term expertise as well as the behavioral functional significance of MNS activity at each timescale. Aim 2. Investigate the role of the MNS in supporting infants? social interactive competence. A foundational set of social abilities emerges in the second year, including imitative learning, helping, and communicative skill, and these skills require rapid responses to others? goal-directed actions. Research with adults has shown that the MNS supports rapid responses to others? actions, raising the possibility that this may also occur during early development. To investigate this possibility Aim 2 will investigate the effects of action priming on infants? imitation, helping, and communicative behavior, as well as the neural correlates of these social behaviors. Aim 3. Investigate longitudinal relations between early MNS activity and later social abilities. As yet, the longer-term developmental implications of MNS activity have not been studied in human infants. In Aim 3, we will follow infants longitudinally from 12 to 30 months, assessing individual variation in early MNS activity as a predictor of later-emerging social skills. Across these three aims, we will consider the role that the social context may play in modulating the MNS and the functions it supports. Most research to date has focused on the effects of motor experience. However, emerging evidence suggests that social experience may also be an important modulator of the MNS. Social interventions, and measures of social interaction with caretakers, will be used to evaluate the potential effects of social experience on the MNS and the social-cognitive functions it may support.", ,,,
,9406371,"Whenever premature birth interrupts normal retinal vascularization of the developing eye, retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) can occur. When ROP was first reported in the 1940?s, it was associated with high, oxygen delivery to preterm infants. Though oxygen delivery to preterm infants is now carefully regulated, ROP is still a common occurrence. In very low birthweight infants (birth weights <1500g), ROP incidence exceeds 25%. Despite treatment for advanced disease, ROP is a leading cause of visual disability in the U.S. and abroad. The current understanding of ROP is that ROP initiates due to a delay in retinal vascularization which leads to retinal ischemia and ultimately to advanced, vasoproliferative disease. Though photocoagulation and vitrectomy are used to treat late stage ROP, there is a high unmet need for preventative agents. An important mission of Zietchick Research Institute, LLC (ZRI), is to develop new therapeutics for maternal/child eye health. In this Phase I SBIR grant project, ZRI will establish proof-of-principle that a hormone-enriched therapeutic for premature infants can serve as a game-changing strategy for ROP prevention. In this proposal, ZRI will first present strong preliminary data that two related hormones, human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) and luteinizing hormone (LH), influence retinal vessel formation. ZRI will next present two research aims. For Aim I, ZRI will quantify levels of hCG and LH on stored biosamples from human preterm infants to show that these hormone levels are significantly lower in ROP cases compared to controls. For Aim 2, ZRI will demonstrate that neonatal mice who lack hCG/LH receptors have abnormal retinal vascularization, resembling human ROP. Successful completion of these two aims will allow ZRI to proceed to Phase II to develop a hormone-based therapeutic for pre-clinical testing which will ultimately reduce the burden of pediatric blindness all over the world.", ,,,
,9329357,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Berkeley Center on the Economics and Demography of Aging (CEDA) has had NIA support for 19 years. During that time, CEDA has earned an international reputation as one of the leading research centers in the world for the economics and demography of aging, complementing the Department of Demography as a leading training program in demography and aging. CEDA membership has grown from about a dozen initially, to 39 members now, with primary disciplinary affiliations in Demography (11), Economics (22), Biology (4), and Sociology (2). The 39 members of CEDA are exceptionally distinguished, including: 1 Nobel Prize, 4 John Bates Clark, 5 Nat Academy of Science, 2 MacArthur, 3 Sheps, 1 Taueber, and 3 Arrow Awards. CEDA has fully or partially funded 18 major workshops during the first four years of the current grant cycle and 16 pilot awards; CEDA support has resulted in 32 grant applications and 9 R-series NIH grants. Prominent dissemination has been via National Academy of Science panels, and adoption of methods and concepts by major entities such as the United Nations. CEDA research encompasses four signature themes: (1)  Demographic and fiscal consequences of global aging, including the National Transfer Accounts project, (2)  Mortality and health, including the Human Mortality Database project, (3) Biodemography of aging, and (4)  Behavioral economics. Highly innovative new applications are forthcoming in the next cycle for promoting  path-breaking research on the economics and demography of aging in all four areas, including projects  cutting across these areas such as empirical Bayesian mortality projection methods, genomic analysis of  longevity, and behavioral economics analysis and novel intervention applications around financial and health  behaviors.

,9353446,"Project Summary The proposed project is in response to the U01 Funding Opportunity Announcement (FOA) for the Big Data to Knowledge (BD2K) Development of Software Tools and Methods for Biomedical Big Data in the topic area of applying metadata. The overall goal here is to design, develop and evaluate an integrated platform for clinical research metadata standardization leveraging both standards-based representation and scalable Semantic Web technologies. The ultimate goal is to advance clinical research data discovery and analytic capabilities for clinical and translational centers and investigators. Clinical and translational research studies increasingly involve the manipulation of large datasets (e.g., patient records and genomic profiles) and the application of complex methods. To derive clinically relevant conclusions from such large datasets, the clinical and translational research community faces significant data integration challenges related to scalability, interactivity, representation standards, sustainability, and robustness. Failure to deal with these challenges will have a significant negative impact on downstream data reuse, sharing and analysis in the broader scientific communities. Detailed Clinical Models (DCMs) have been regarded as the basis for retaining computable meaning when data are exchanged between heterogeneous clinical systems. Amongst the emerging national and international initiatives on the standardization of DCM modeling are the Clinical Informatics Modeling Initiative (CIMI) and the HL7 Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR). FHIR is an emerging HL7 standard; it leverages existing logical and theoretical models to provide a consistent, easy to implement, and rigorous mechanism for exchanging data between healthcare applications. However, currently the toolbox that enables HL7 FHIR as a global data model to standardize clinical research metadata is very limited. Such metadata include data dictionaries associated with clinical research datasets and a variety of underlying data models in the existing integrated data repositories (IDRs) such as the Informatics for Integrating Biology and the Bedside (i2b2). The proposed project leverages emerging Semantic Web technologies to provide a scalable standards-based framework that enables effective and efficient big data integration and semantic sharing. The proposed project builds on semantic metadata software and infrastructure developed in our previous projects, including an NIH U24 bioCADDIE (biomedical and healthCAre Data Discovery Index Ecosystem) pilot project (PI: Jiang) that investigates the feasibility of indexing clinical research datasets using HL7 FHIR, and an NCI U01 supplement (PI: Jiang) that creates an open-source IDR (e.g., i2b2) with FHIR- based cancer data services for cancer research. The objective of the proposed project is to consolidate, develop, and evaluate methods and tools for standardizing clinical research metadata and data models using HL7 FHIR. Our specific aims are: 1) Consolidate our bioCADDIE tools for indexing clinical research metadata using HL7 FHIR; 2) Create methods and tools for integrating i2b2 clinical data repository with HL7 FHIR; 3) Deploy an integrated web-portal for community-based metadata harmonization and tool dissemination. The proposed project will produce a suite of methods and tools for clinical research metadata standardization using HL7 FHIR and effectively facilitate secondary use of clinical research data and applications, ultimately advancing clinical and translational data discovery and analytics.", ,,,
,9379308,"Project Summary Positron emitters result in the detection of coincident 511 keV annihilation photons. Thus, it is not possible to perform dual radiotracer studies in PET as is done SPECT, where energy discrimination may be performed. This grant application's significance lies in that it proposes a method to separate two PET radiotracers injected during the same PET imaging session. As a proof of principle, we shall inject two radiotracers commonly employed in cancer imaging: FMISO (tumor hypoxia) and FLT (cellular proliferation). If successful, our study would show the feasibility to provide the spatial delineation of tumor hypoxia and proliferation within the same imaging session. Although it will be applied to both, our approach is not restricted to FMISO and FLT; it could be applied to a number of radiotracer pairs. As is the case of PET/MR, dual tracer imaging makes it possible to measure two phenotypic properties of the tumor, which may vary temporally when the tumor is in the same state. Moreover, it offers greater patient convenience than sequential acquisitions, e.g., on separate days. In this project, therefore, we propose to validate a method to simultaneously image tumor hypoxia and proliferation within a single PET study in an animal tumor model. A dynamic PET acquisition is performed while the two radiotracers, 18FMISO and 18FLT, are injected sequentially, closely staggered in time. Retrospective 18FMISO /18FLT separation of imaging signals will be based on a priori knowledge of tissue pharmacokinetics and the ability to distinguish these two radiotracers in blood samples by thin-layer chromatography (TLC). If successful, this approach, which is immediately translatable into the clinic, would set the stage for patient studies in which dual radiotracer studies would be useful.", ,,,
,9336154,"?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): High-throughput sequencing (HTS), a technology to unravel DNA sequences on a large scale, is pervasive in clinical and biological applications such as studying the spectrum of genetic variations and their relation to disease. Due to further reductions in cost, sequencing is expected to gain significant momentum, since it will replace commonly used genetic tests in clinical care for life-threatening diseases such as cancer, and consequently produce enormous amounts of data. The rise of personalized medicine will eventually lead to the point where every individual can be routinely screened for genetic risk factors using HTS. The goal of the proposed research is to boost the analysis of HTS data with a compressive genomics middle-ware that provides compressed reduced representations of HTS data. The representations are meaningful in that sequence information which is likely to cover the same genomic location in the sequenced genome will be brought together. As existing and future methods and algorithms can operate directly on this representation, the proposal not only realizes a saving in space and transmission times, but also in CPU time needed for analysis. The project has three aims: 1) Develop a clustering algorithm for single and paired HTS read libraries that rapidly recognized overlapping. Establish a lossless compression scheme based on clusters, which facilitates downstream computations directly on the compressed data without decompression. Extend the approach to joint compression of multiple HTS libraries. 2) Introduce meaningful reduced representations which further decrease memory demands by prioritizing sequence information likely to be correct and discarding information likely to be erroneous. 3) Adapt important HTS analysis tools to our compressive genomics approach, in particular read mapping, de novo genome assembly by using cluster consensus sequences as virtual, elongated reads for a hybrid assembly scheme, and discovery of structural variants based on cluster mapping positions and ambiguities in assignment of sequences to clusters. Our results will aid in improving health care outcomes by increasing analysis quality, lowering costs and making the analysis of HTS data more widely accessible. This will impact areas of scientific inquiry from understanding genetic variations underlying disease to personal genomics.", ,,,
,9335337,"The Gram negative subgingival anaerobic bacterium Porphyromonas gingivalis is capable of avoiding host innate immune recognition, ensuring both its survival and that of bystander bacterial species in dental plaque. It has been associated with causing dysbiosis of the oral microflora in animal models of infection that results in periodontitis. Our goal was to identify novel P. gingivalis genetic determinants required for immune evasion. In preliminary data, we describe the construction of a transposon-based P. gingivalis mutant library, which was subjected to an in vitro screen we developed to isolate mutants that incur a strong pro-inflammatory response, distinct from non-inflammatory wild-type strains, including the parental strain employed in this study, 33277. We obtained a mutant, called J5-c5, that stimulated a pro-inflammatory response via activation of the immune receptor TLR4. Modulation of the host TLR4 response is a primary means by which P. gingivalis avoids immune elimination. P. gingivalis can modify its lipid A, the TLR4 ligand, from a penta-acylated TLR4-agonistic structure to tetra-acylated TLR4-anatagonistic and TLR4-inert structures. We hypothesized that lipid A in J5-c5 is largely penta-acylated, which was confirmed by MALDI-TOF chromatography. Lack of tetra-acylated lipid A is consistent with loss of a functional lipid A deacylase, a critical enzyme that remains unidentified. Whole genome sequencing revealed the presence and location of five transposon insertions in J5-c5. Our goal now has become to identify the specific insertion site responsible for loss of deacylase activity, and to elucidate the reason behind this loss. In Aim 1, we will construct five separate 33277 mutants, each with a tetQ insertion in the same location as one of the five transposon insertions. The mutant with the same phenotype as J5-c5 will reveal the locus required for deacylation. The disrupted locus could be required for structure, such as a gene coding for the deacylase itself or a protein required for deacylase assembly; or could play an essential role in regulation of deacylase gene transcription, all of these possibilities will be investigated in this proposal. In Aim 2, we will compare global RNA expression patterns between wild-type and J5-C5, using RNAseq, to determine whether dysregulation of deacylase gene expression explains loss of deacylase activity. Of note, two lipid A deacylases identified so far in other bacteria are transcriptionally regulated. Differential RNA expression will also identify the gene encoding the deacylase, or the gene required for deacylase assembly, that has been rendered non-functional in J5-c5 either directly by the insertion or indirectly by regulation. Deacylase gene identification will enable the study of its expression levels in P. gingivalis strains that exhibit different levels of virulence, and strains from different in vivo locations. It will be crucial to investigate whether and how the gene is regulated. Importantly, it will fill a critical gap in understanding the molecular basis of an essential mechanism used by P. gingivalis to evade the host immune response", ,,,

The significance of the proposed pilot projects program is its alignment with this University-based strategic plan providing focus and an aggregation of resources that will accelerate discoveries and translations. We will accomplish these aims with an innovative approach of fostering collaborative teams of scientists and clinicians with the specific focus on translational strategies for discoveries aimed at improving and repairing skeletal, cartilage and joint health. In addition to supporting and promoting feasibility studies in the translation of discoveries for improving and repairing skeletal, cartilage and joint health, we will provide mentoring for the both the basic scientists and clinician-scientists. This will be accomplished with direct mentoring and with a didactic program. The pilot program itself will be supported by a mentoring council that will assist project mentors and coordinate mentoring efforts across the program.

,9349521,"Project Summary Several compelling questions in genome sequence analysis have been compromised by errors and gaps in the available genome assemblies. A telomere-to-telomere platinum-quality genome sequence of a human would open doors to investigating many problems associated with genetic disease, and development of platinum-quality model organism genomes will allow early exploration of the most efficient ways to pursue these questions. To demonstrate the utility of multiple reference-quality genomes, we have formulated several questions about genome evolution that make use of the Drosophila model system. These questions include (1) identifying new genes that originated within the Drosophila-specific clade, (2) estimating the rates of new gene evolution and examine the variation and constancy of those rates among Drosophila lineages, (3) quantifying rates and patterns of divergence of piRNA clusters, critical to host regulation of transposable elements, (4) analysis of sequence divergence in heterochromatic repeats, known to play key roles in centromere and telomere function as well as modulating chromatin states, and (5) analysis of Y chromosome gene and loss across the pan-Y chromosome. By obtaining and annotating reference-quality genome sequences of 19 Drosophila species spanning 40-60 MY of evolutionary history, using an efficient scheme that combines deep long-read (PacBio) assembly coupled with targeted sequencing of bacterial artificial chromosomes, we will produce a resource that will pave the way for the Drosophila community to tackle pressing hypothesis-driven questions in the field, including embryonic development, neurobiology, and aging ? all within a phylogenomics perspective.", ,,,
,9337457,"ABSTRACT Our long term goal is to elucidate the mechanisms responsible for the functional polarity and retinal- support functions of the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE). The vast array of support functions the RPE performs for the neural retina require RPE-specific polarity of solute transporters, channels and nutrient receptors and functional tight junctions. The polarity of RPE transporters is frequently opposite to the polarity displayed by the same transporters in other body epithelia. Our central hypothesis is that the organization of RPE polarity and its selective blood-retinal barrier properties is dictated by a tissue-specific configuration of the trafficking machinery in RPE cells and by instructive interactions from choroid endothelial cells. Indeed, we recently reported that RPE cells lack a key clathrin adaptor, AP1B, that sorts basolateral PM proteins in most body epithelia, which explains the reversed apical polarity or non-polarized distribution of several RPE PM proteins (e.g. the coxsackie adenovirus receptor (CAR) and neural adhesion molecule (NCAM)). On the other hand, the mechanisms that regulate the reversed apical polarity of some basolateral PM protein in RPE, e.g. the chloride channel ClC-2 and Na,K-ATPase is not explained by lack of this clathrin adaptor. The research plan of this proposal is focused on understanding the sorting mechanisms and functions of proteins involved in the transport of fluid by RPE, a process of major significance in RPE physiology and retinal pathology, and on characterizing a novel choroid-supported mechanism for the assembly of functional RPE tight junctions. Specific aim 1 will focus on ClC-2, a key basolateral regulator of cell volume in many epithelia which we recently found, unexpectedly, to be localized to the apical PM and primary cilium of RPE. Specific aim 2 will focus on NKCC-1 a key Cl- co-transporter in the apical PM of RPE which is expressed basolaterally in other body epithelia and on Bestrophin, a basolateral chloride channel which was recently crystallized and is now therefore amenable for structure-function sorting studies. Finally, specific aim 3 will characterize an exciting new mechanism we have uncovered that regulates the blood-retinal outer barrier through choroid endothelial signals that regulate the maturation of the Bruch basement membrane. We anticipate that the new information and concepts provided by these studies will contribute important insights on the Physiology and Pathology of the Outer Retina that may help generate novel therapeutic strategies for the treatment of diseases of the outer retina.", ,,,
,9341365,"?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) is an evolutionarily conserved serine/threonine kinase complex. It is a central regulator of cellular anabolic processes by integrating a variety of upstream inputs, including growth factors, nutrients, energy and oxygen status. It is being increasingly appreciated that downstream targets of mTORC1 can communicate with its upstream regulators, through various feedback loops. These feedback mechanisms play a critical role in stabilizing the entire network. They also have great significance in a variety of human diseases. For example, aberrant mTORC1 activation (e.g. as a result of chronic overfeeding) can cause insulin resistance, a hallmark of type 2 diabetes. The feedback loops are also particularly relevant in cancer biology. mTORC1 is hyperactivated in a major faction of human cancers. Unfortunately, inhibition of mTORC1 using rapamycin analogs (rapalogs) as single agents is cytostatic but not cytotoxic. This is mainly due to the activation of upstream, pro-survival kinases (e.g. Akt) upon mTORC1 inhibition. Understanding how to avoid the relief of feedback loops will be critical to overcome rapamycin resistance for treating human cancer. To this end, we recently used a quantitative phosphoproteomic approach to systematically characterizing the mTOR-regulated phosphoproteome. Detailed biochemical characterization of a novel mTORC1 substrate, Grb10, showed that mTORC1-mediated phosphorylation stabilized this protein, which led to its accumulation, and subsequent inhibition of insulin and IGF1 signaling. Our unpublished results further indicate that cells with hyperactive mTORC1 also secrete a protein(s) that is able to block IGF1 signaling. In this proposal, we will investigate how mTORC1 may inhibit the function of IGF1 through remodeling the secretome. In Aim 1, we will use a quantitative mass spectrometry approach to comprehensively characterizing the mTORC1-regulated secretome. In Aim 2, we will elucidate the molecular mechanism by which mTORC1 regulates the expression of this secreted protein, and determine its role in mTORC1-mediated feedback inhibition of IGF1 signaling. In Aim3, we will investigate the non-cell autonomous function of this secreted protein, and its interplay with Grb10 in vivo. We will accomplish our goals with a multi- disciplinary approach, utilizing tools including proteomics, biochemistry, molecular biology and animal models. The results will greatly facilitate our understanding of mTORC1-mediated feedback loops. Knowledge we garner in this proposal will also be necessary to further explore how we might better target these feedback mechanisms for treating various human diseases.", ,,,
,9331665,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Over 100,000 people in the US suffer from primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) caused by mutations in the MYOC gene. This form of POAG results from optic nerve damage caused by the death of a protective cell network called the trabecular meshwork (TM). TM cell death occurs in these cases because mutant myocilin abnormally accumulates into toxic aggregates. This mechanism is reminiscent of neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's, Huntington's and Parkinson's, where abnormal proteins accumulate in neurons and lead to cell death. In fact, TM cells are long-lived just like neurons. Moreover, mutations that cause earlier POAG onset also make myocilin aggregate more readily, similar to proteins associated with neurodegenerative diseases. Thus, both types of diseases can be considered proteostasis disorders, meaning that long-lived cells (neurons and TM) progressively lose their ability to prevent the toxic accumulation of mutant proteins with age. Thus, strategies aimed at restoring proteostasis in TM cells could be beneficial for glaucoma, just as they have proven for neurodegenerative disease.  Through a series of studies, we determined that the Grp94 chaperone (an Hsp90 isoform) that resides in the endoplasmic reticulum, mistakenly preserves mutant myocilin in cells. Importantly, Grp94 only affects misfolded myocilin: Properly folded and functioning myocilin is unaffected by Grp94 manipulation. Grp94 recognizes only myocilin that is misfolded due to either mutations or impaired glycosylation: But Grp94 is unable to clear this misfolded myocilin, and instead, preserves it, causing its toxic accumulation. Thus, myocilin misfolding disrupts proteostasis by mistakenly engaging the Grp94 chaperone. We have shown that the clearance of toxic myocilin can be accelerated simply by inhibiting Grp94!  Our team has developed the first isoform selective Grp94 inhibitor termed BnIm. Because the list of Grp94-dependent substrates is small, compared to other Hsp90 isoforms, the toxicity profile for this Grp94 inhibitor also appears low. Therefore, we propose to validate and improve upon this Grp94 inhibitor for the treatment of myocilin-associated POAG by establishing structure-activity relationships of Grp94 inhibitors to elucidate mechanisms of misfolded myocilin triage. We will also evaluate the biological efficacy of Grp94 inhibitors towards mutant myocilin in disease relevant systems and then work to develop Grp94 inhibitors with greater efficacy and biological activity towards misfolded myocilin. These studies will result in a new suite of Grp94 modulators and demonstrate that Grp94 is a novel clinical target to treat glaucoma caused by misfolded myocilin. In addition, mechanisms identified herein that clarify how Grp94 regulates myocilin triage could provide new insights for other proteostasis diseases.", ,,,
,9353748,"As one of the five current CPTAC PCCs, we propose to leverage our established center to further our research in the comprehensive characterization of biospecimens from human and preclinical models for additional cancer types. We have assembled an outstanding team of basic and clinical scientists to discover and confirm proteins and protein modifications associated with cancer progression using genoproteomic approaches. This multidisciplinary team will be managed by the same three Principal Investigators (PI) and consists of internationally recognized experts in proteomic technologies, genomics, proteogenomics-specific bioinformatics, biostatistics, oncology, pathology, cancer biology, assay development, quality control, technology optimization, and clinical laboratory science/clinical chemistry. Our team has complementary and integrated expertise with previous and ongoing successful collaborations. The plan is to integrate the genomics findings with proteomic analysis (genoproteomics) and to overcome the caveats and challenges in the comprehensive understanding of tumor biology. We believe that genomic data provides a highly valuable molecular route towards the identification of genes and pathways that could be useful for the detection, differential diagnosis, outcome prediction and therapeutic targets of cancer. The proteomic approaches will provide the identification of unique features that are inherent to proteins including post-translational modifications, such as glycosylation and phosphorylation. We propose to use the technology platform validated during the current CPTAC which is high throughput, robust and state of the art. These technologies are proven, with the capability of generating reproducible results across labs. We will use a two-step strategy to characterize defined sets of genomically-characterized samples. The first step is the discovery of target proteins from both biological and clinical specimens using mass spectrometry and affinity based technologies. The second step is the confirmation of these targets using high-throughput, CPTAC Tier 2 analytically validated targeted assays, for example, Multiple Reaction Monitoring Mass Spectrometry (MRM-MS). In addition, we propose to develop pilot studies for technology improvement. The goal is to generate accurate, reproducible, sensitive, quantitative, and multiplexed assays using optimized and standardized high-throughput technologies for the discovered targets. While this PCC application is focused on the proteomic characterization of biological and clinical specimens, we believe that the understanding of and expertise in proteogenomic data analysis and translation will be critical for the success of the PCC and the overall CPTAC network. Investigators/PIs from our proposed PCC will be part of applications for the CPTAC Proteogenomic Data Analysis (PGDAC) and Translational Research (PTCR) Centers. Collaboration and team work are key to the success of the CPTAC program. With this multidisciplinary team of outstanding basic and clinical scientists, our PCC offers the best opportunity for the successful characterization of biological and clinical specimens to discover and confirm cancer targets to advance precision cancer medicine.", ,,,

,9338109,"ABSTRACT  Despite stabilizing rates of prescription opioid pain reliever (OPR) overdoses, opioid-related mortality continues to rise because of increasing rates of heroin use and poisoning. Between 2013 and 2014, national estimates of nonmedical use of OPRs in the previous year declined from 11.08 to 10.34 million individuals. In contrast, heroin use increased from 0.68 to 0.91 million individuals. Mortality from heroin increased 26% in the last year and more than 300% over the last five years. The shift in trend is more than ecologic, as 40% to 70% of individuals who use heroin report nonmedical use of an OPR prior to initiating heroin. This is a substantial departure from historical trajectories of heroin use. For the great majority of individuals who began heroin use in the 1960s, heroin was their first opioid. While the risk of transition to heroin from nonmedical use of OPRs is low, contributing and pre-disposing factors are poorly understood. The burden of OPR and heroin-related adverse events is particularly high for individuals in Medicaid programs because they are more likely to have substance use disorders and are disproportionately represented among overdose deaths. The state of Oregon recently developed a state Performance Improvement Project (PIP) to reduce the proportion of high-dose opioid prescriptions in its Medicaid program, which is now delivered through 16 regionally and health system defined Coordinated Care Organizations (CCOs). Because each CCO has flexibility to address the state's PIP, implementation across CCOs constitutes a natural experiment to study policy factors associated with change in OPR prescribing and heroin-related outcomes. In response to RFA-CE-16-003 (Research on Prescription Opioid Use, Opioid Prescribing, and Associated Heroin Risk; Priority #2), the objective of this study is to evaluate the relationships between OPR prescribing, CCO opioid dose reduction initiatives on patterns of OPR utilization, heroin use, and opioid-related overdoses. The objective is achieved through three Specific Aims using a mixed methods approach. First, using a multisource linked database that includes prescription drug monitoring program (PDMP), Medicaid claims, vital statistics, and substance use treatment data from Oregon, relationships between OPR prescribing patterns and heroin-related outcomes will be tested. Second, using qualitative research methods, policies and procedures directed at improving the statewide high dose PIP by each CCO will be characterized. Finally, the effect of implementation of CCO PIP initiatives on high-risk OPR use and heroin-related outcomes will be evaluated. Findings from this study will contribute to our understanding of individual risk factors for transition to and overdose with heroin. Also, knowledge gained will assist local and national decision makers about policy levers to reduce the burden of OPR and heroin- related morbidity and mortality.", ,,,
,9330865,"Diabetic eye disease is a leading cause of blindness in working-age adults. More than 70% of diabetic patients suffer from corneal problems, mainly from neuropathy and epithelial keratopathy (impaired barrier function and wound healing, recurrent erosions, epithelial keratitis, etc.), which can reduce vision, and cause discomfort and pain. Diabetic keratopathy is underdiagnosed, and therapy is limited to symptom control. We have discovered downregulation of putative limbal epithelial stem cells (LESC) markers in diabetic corneas and cultured diabetic LESC; normalized marker expression and epithelial wound healing in organ-cultured human diabetic corneas by adenoviral gene therapy of LESC-harboring limbus; designed a new fast method of denuding human amniotic membrane (HAM) for cell growth; showed that diabetic cells on HAM could be transplanted to the debrided corneas. Overall, we uncovered alterations in diabetic LESCs, normalized their marker expression, corrected impaired wound healing by gene therapy, and were able to transplant them on HAM to denuded corneas. We designed diabetic cornea-tailored non-toxic gene therapy vehicles, natural-derived polymalic acid-based nanobioconjugates (NBC). They bind to targeted cells by attached antibodies and modulate specific markers with antisense oligonucleotides (AON). We propose to use these new NBCs to safely and efficiently normalize diabetic LESC. Diabetes is associated with stable epigenetic changes, e.g., altered DNA methylation. A novel way of normalizing diabetic LESC would be to remove methylation changes. We propose to achieve this by generating induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) from diabetic LESC and differentiating iPSCs to limbal cells. Our main hypothesis is that normalization of diabetic limbal epithelial stem cells and wound healing could be achieved by using new non-toxic nanobioconjugate gene therapy and/or by transplantable functionally normal limbal epithelial cells obtained from diabetic LESC-derived iPSCs. Specific Aim 1. To develop a safe gene therapy for diabetic LESC using novel nanobioconjugates modulating diabetic markers by antisense inhibition. The NBCs will be designed to downregulate diabetes- increased cathepsin F and MMP-10, and upregulate diabetes-decreased c-met. Specific Aim 2. Specific Aim 2. To develop a novel way of normalizing cultured diabetic LESC by generating iPSC from LESC and redifferentiating the iPSCs back to limbal epithelial cells. We predict that iPSC would shed some diabetic epigenetic methylation, allowing to convert them to normal limbal cells. Specific Aim 3. Specific Aim 3. To achieve transplantation of nanodrug-treated and of diabetic iPSC- derived limbal cells on HAM on the diabetic corneas and compare restoration of normal stem cell marker expression and wound healing. iPSC and nano gene therapy will be compared for efficacy. Our aims fit the priorities of NEI Vision Research: improving transplantation of cultured corneal epithelial cells, understanding epigenetics of wound healing, and developing methods to enhance wound healing.", ,,,
,9304955,"Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a chronic, relapsing inflammatory skin disorder that affects 15-20% of children worldwide. In addition to the characteristic lesions accompanied by intense itching, AD increases the risk of microbial colonization and allergic responses including food allergy, allergic rhinitis, and asthma, in a process referred to as the atopic march. It was noted over 40 years ago that AD lesions were frequently colonized by Staphylococcus aureus. Recently, lesions from AD patients were discovered to be colonized by both S. aureus and S. epidermidis strains that formed biofilms, which are adhesive surface-attached colonies that become highly resistant to antibiotics and immune responses. S. epidermidis is a normal skin commensal that in some contexts can antagonize S. aureus biofilm growth. However, we have found that S. aureus and S. epidermidis are capable of forming synergistic mixed biofilms when co-cultured, which is consistent with recent skin microbiome surveys showing increased prevalence of both S. aureus and S. epidermidis on AD lesional skin. Data from our lab and others has shown that staphylococcal biofilm growth is dependent on intercellular adhesion events mediated by the Aap and SasG proteins expressed on the surfaces of S. epidermidis and S. aureus, respectively. It has recently been shown that Aap and SasG can mediate heterophilic adhesion events between S. epidermidis and S. aureus cells. Our central hypothesis is that such heterophilic protein adhesion events facilitate the growth of strong mixed-species staphylococcal biofilms on AD lesional skin, which promote inflammation, compromise skin barrier function, and result in more severe AD and progression to asthma. Through the proposed aims, we will 1) test whether heterophilic protein interactions between Aap and SasG allow synergistic growth of mixed-species biofilms between Staphylococcus spp colonizing AD but not normal skin; 2) delineate the mechanistic basis by which mixed biofilms promote disease; and 3) test whether synergistic staphylococcal strains that make the strongest mixed biofilms are associated with AD severity, barrier dysfunction, and progression to asthma in M-PAACH children.", ,,,
,9338256,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     Regulated exit from cell division and initiation of a non-proliferative quiescent state is a criticl requirement in all organisms. Failure to maintain quiescence and inappropriate reinitiation of proliferative cell growth underlies many human cancers. Conversely, subpopulations of quiescent tumor cells may play critical roles in resistance to chemotherapy and tumor recurrence as cancer drugs typically target processes active during cell growth. Similarly, quiescent pathogenic microbes are frequently insensitive to standard drug treatments. We will use the single-celled eukaryotic microbes, Saccharomyces cerevisiae (budding yeast) and Schizosaccharomyces pombe (fission yeast) to identify the conserved networks that regulate cell quiescence. Microbes and some tumor cells enter quiescent states in response to nutrient depletion and are able to survive for prolonged periods of nutrient starvation. Our preliminary studies demonstrate that initiation of quiescence in response to defined nutrient starvation is actively regulated by conserved signaling pathways including the TORC1, Ras/Protein kinase A (PKA) and AMPK pathways. In Aim 1 we will define the conserved genetic program that controls cell quiescence by quantifying the defect in quiescence attributable to loss of function mutations in each gene in both budding and fission yeast in three quiescence-inducing conditions: carbon, nitrogen and phosphorous starvation. We will complement this genetic approach with studies of the phenotypic hallmarks of quiescence in wildtype and mutant cells to identify processes defective in quiescent mutants. In Aim 2 we will study how signaling pathways integrate environmental information to initiate the quiescence program by identifying targets of quiescence-regulating pathways and interactions between pathways using genome-wide genetic interaction mapping in quiescent conditions in both species. These experiments will allow us to identify conserved functional interactions that enable the cell to initiate quiescence n response to specific pro-quiescence signals while simultaneously receiving pro-growth signals that activate parallel pathways. We hypothesize that one means of coordinating signaling pathways is by dynamic subcellular localization of their components and we will test this hypothesis using mutants in which signaling components are mislocalized. In Aim 3 we will quantify variation in mRNA synthesis and degradation rates as cells enter quiescence using in vivo metabolic labeling of mRNAs coupled with RNA-Seq. We will use this method to test whether cells alter the stability of specific transcripts as cell growth slows and they enter quiescence. We will then identify conserved determinants of mRNA degradation variation using computational methods. By focusing on conserved signaling pathways and cellular processes that regulate quiescence we will enhance our understanding of quiescence in both normal and diseased human cells as well as microbial pathogens. A detailed understanding of cell quiescence will ultimately enable new therapeutic strategies that specifically target quiescent cells in a variety of pathological settings including cancer and microbial infections.", ,,,
,9346578,"Project Summary/Abstract Antibiotic use is the primary selective force behind the emergence of resistant bacteria. Therefore, optimizing strategies for antibiotic use (`stewardship') is an essential component of efforts to combat antimicrobial resistance, particularly in clinical settings. Optimization of antibiotic use requires measurement. Antibiotics have been available for use in animals for over 60 years, but systematic efforts to measure antibiotic use in animals at a national scale are a relatively recent undertaking. To inform stewardship programs, systems are needed for the systematic collection of on-farm antibiotic use data that reliably reflect the intensity of antibiotic use in food animal industries and advance knowledge of the principal indications for use and methods of administration (dose, route, duration) of specific antibiotic compounds. This project will focus on antibiotic use data collection in the poultry and swine production systems of the U.S. and will assemble a multi-disciplinary team with expertise in multiple species to evaluate metrics for analyzing, reporting and summarizing the data. Long-term this project will establish platforms for the consistent and sustainable collection of antibiotic use data on-farm. This project addresses all of the key characteristics needed in a system for collecting on-farm antibiotic use data. Specifically, our system will focus on the broiler chicken, turkey, table egg and swine industries of the U.S. to: 1) Provide detailed antimicrobial drug use data that accurately reflects actual on-farm use, 2) Provide ?baseline? data on antimicrobial use (i.e., data prior to the implementation of Guidance For Industry (GFI) #213), 3) Pilot methodologies for collecting, summarizing, and reporting antimicrobial use data, 4) Foster public-private partnerships/collaboration, 5) Leverage existing data systems and minimize burden and disruption to animal producers, and 6) Incorporate strategies for protecting farm/producer identity and other confidential information.", ,,,
,9343052,"?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The mammalian brain maintains the capacity to generate new neurons for tissue homeostasis and after injuries, which is driven by neural stem/progenitor cells (NSCs). The long term goal of the proposed studies is to understand the molecular and cellular mechanisms of autophagy pathway and genes in the regulation of NSCs. Autophagy is a highly conserved cellular process for maintenance of cellular homeostasis, and dysfunctions in autophagy have been implicated in many disorders, including neurodegenerative diseases. Despite increasing research on autophagy in recent years, little is known about the role and mechanisms of autophagy in the regulation of tissue stem cells such as NSCs. FIP200 (FAK-family Interacting Protein of 200 kDa) was initially identified in our laboratory and later shown as one component of the ULK1/Atg13/FIP200 complex essential for autophagy induction. Very recently, we showed that conditional knockout (cKO) of FIP200 resulted in the depletion of NSCs and their aberrant differentiation, providing the first evidence for a role of autophagy in postnatal NSCs. In prelim studies, we found that autophagy inhibition by deletion of Atg5 or Atg16L1 (autophagy genes required for autophagosome maturation) did not affect NSCs, and further comparative analyses of FIP200, Atg5 and Atg16L1 cKO mice suggested that FIP200, but not Atg5 and Atg16L1, deletion caused p62 aggregation in NSCs. Generation and analysis of a FIP200 and p62 double cKO mice suggested that the preferential p62 aggregates formation plays a crucial role in triggering aberrant superoxide increase leading to defective NSCs primarily by impairing SOD functions. In addition, we showed that knockdown of Atg13 (FIP200 partner in the autophagy induction complex) inhibited NSC self-renewal in vitro, and identified residues 582-585 in FIP200 required for its binding to Atg13. We then created a novel FIP200 knock-in mutant mice containing FIP200x allele lacking binding to Atg13 and showed that KI/KI MEFs were defective in both basal and starvation-induced autophagy. Lastly, microarray analysis of neurospheres from various mice revealed elevated expression of multiple genes associated with inflammation upon FIP200 deletion, which were not rescued by p53 inactivation. Moreover, an increased infiltration of microglia was found in the SVZ of FIP200 cKO mice, as well as FIP200 and p53 double cKO mice, suggesting an interesting possibility that the infiltrating microglias may be responsible for the p53-independent, aberrant differentiation of NSCs upon deletion of FIP200. Based on these preliminary and previous studies, we propose to 1). investigate the mechanisms of p62 aggregates in mediating NSC regulation by autophagy, 2). analyze FIP200-mediated autophagy function in the regulation of NSCs, and 3). explore the role and mechanisms of elevated microglia infiltration in the aberrant differentiation of NSCs upon FIP200 ablation. Together, these studies will significantly advance our understanding of the mechanisms of NSC regulation by autophagy that may contribute to future design of more effective therapies for neurodegenerative and other related diseases.", ,,,

,9277457,"?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Overweight females are prone to obesity-associated stress urinary incontinence (OA-SUI), but because the mechanisms underlying its pathology have not been well elucidated, no specific therapies for the condition have been developed. We have identified that dysfunction of urethral and pelvic floor striated muscles contributes to OA-SUI, as atrophy of skeletal muscle often occurs in obese people. Activating endogenous stem/progenitor cells to regenerate damaged muscles could comprise a useful therapeutic approach. However, systemic administration of stem cells or their activators can cause undesirable side effects in off- target organs or tissues. Localized administration of curatives does not resolve this problem, because injected stem or progenitor cells often migrate outside the target area. Our laboratory, which has focused on the biology of endogenous stem/progenitor cells for the past 13 years, is developing a non-invasive method that can recruit and retain these cells at selected sites, or activate them in situ. Our pilot experiments demonstrate that low-energy shock waves (LESW) at a very specific energy level activates urethral and pelvic floor muscle progenitor cells; they also down-regulate the muscle growth inhibitor myostatin. We hypothesize that by activating resident stem cells to grow new myofibers, LESW can reverse OA-SUI. To clarify mechanisms and identify potential clinical approaches, we are also investigating myostatin inhibition via a novel DNA-inhibiting method called clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats interference (CRISPRi). We will use a rodent OA-SUI model to assess structural and functional outcomes of treatment with CRISPRi, LESW, or both, and compare the results with the effects of weight-loss (the first line treatment taken in the clinic). To elucidate how obesity affects the structure and function of the female urethral sphincter and pelvic floor muscles, the molecular mechanisms involved in activating its resident stem cells, and the impacts LESW has on their activation and differentiation. We will also establish the feasibility of inducing regeneration of this muscle by inhibiting myostatin signaling. These objectives lead us to propose the following Specific Aims: 1.To examine the effect of LESW and weight loss in a rat model of obesity-associated urethral and pelvic floor striated muscle dysfunction 2.To enhance the recovery of urethral sphincter and pelvic floor muscle by myostatin inhibition in rats with OA-SUI. 3. To identify the effects of dyslipidemia and hyperglycemia on muscle derived stem cells (MDSC) through the modulation of myostatin signaling, and its counteraction by LESW.", ,,,
,9333376,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Alkaliphilic  Bacillus  pseudofirmus  OF4  grows  at  pH  e  11.2,  but  the  transmembrane  electrochemical gradient of protons, the bulk Protonmotive Force (PMF) that energizes ATP synthesis, is too  low to account for the ATP produced. It is too low because, by necessity, the alkaliphile uses a very effective cation/proton antiporter (exchanger) type, a multi-subunit Mrp antiporter, to maintain a cytoplasmic pH that is as much as 2.3 pH units lower than the external pH. Findings of ATP synthesis at low PMF and new probes  that  can  track  protons  pumped  by  the  respiratory  chain,  contributed  to  a  recent  paradigm  shift,  a  new  consensus that protons emerging on the membrane surface are retained there long enough to reach an ATP  synthase before fully equilibrating with the bulk medium, i.e. energization is by a surface PMF. Interfacial water  barriers  and  charge  distribution  on  the  membrane  surface  are  hypothesized  contributors  to  proton  retention.  The dwell time on the membrane surface also makes pumped protons accessible to membrane proteins that could enhance ATP synthesis by creating domains in which the pumps and synthase are in closer proximity.  Similarly,  outer  membrane  constituents  (in  mitochondria  or Gram-negative  bacteria)  or  cell  wall  associated  polymers, e.g. Secondary Cell Wall Polymers (in Gram-positive bacteria) may contribute to proton retention by  delaying proton loss from the periplasm. With the whole pharmacology of ATP synthesis changing in this new paradigm, we will systematically use knock-outs to explore roles of Secondary Cell Wall Polymers and Flotillin- related membrane proteins in ATP synthesis efficacy in the alkaliphile model system. Earlier findings of motifs  in  the  alkaliphile  c-rotor  of  ATP  synthase  that  promote  synthesis,  will  inform  new  studies  of  the  catalytic  properties of Staphylococcus aureus ATP synthase and the structure/function properties of its c-subunit rotor,  which are recognized potential antibiotic targets in this major pathogen. The Mrp-type antiporters play crucial roles in S.  aureus  as  well  as  in  a  large  group  of  other  pathogens  that  thrive in  non-fermentative  high  energization contexts. Structural studies will be initiated on the alkaliphile Mrp antiporter, which could provide invaluable information for inhibitor design. The ful cohort of S.  aureus  antiporters,  including  two  Mrp-type  antiporters and six others from three different antiporter groups, will also be characterized with respect to their  activity profiles, expression levels under diverse conditions and the effect of their deletion on S. aureus growth  under  a  matrix  of  conditions.  This  will  identify  additional  antiporters  with  target  potntial  and  fill  a  knowledge  gap that impedes our ability to model the patho-physiological behavior of S. aureus.

,9333394,"Title: Modified Phase 3B of a 3-phase 1.3-GHz LTS/HTS NMR magnet Application #: GM114834-11A1 PI: Yukikazu Iwasa, Francis Bitter Magnet Laboratory, Plasma Science and Fusion  Center, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge MA Date: August 10, 2015 New Abstract Information In the simplest view of NMR, the advantages of higher field are improved sensitivity and resolution. Spectroscopy basically consists of measuring frequencies and amplitudes. Resolution gives frequency information. Sensitivity gives amplitude information. Both sensitivity per unit time in signal averaging experiments and resolution for 3D experiments improve as ?3. Thus, going up in frequency, for example, from 800 MHz to 1.3 GHz, sensitivity and resolution scale up by a factor of 4.3. In solution NMR most protein solution NMR experiments utilize the TROSY effect to optimize the resolution of the experiments. Initially it was predicted that TROSY experiments would be optimal at ~900 MHz. However, more recent experimental data and simulations on several proteins indicate that the resolution is optimized in the range 1200?1400 MHz (vide infra). In magic-angle-spinning (MAS) solid-state NMR, the higher the field the more optimal. Many cutting-edge structural biology questions such as ribosomal protein synthesis, virus entry into cells, ion channels implicated in human diseases, will become accessible to solid-state NMR investigation at higher magnetic fields. This modified Phase 3B program has two specific aims: Aim 1) successful completion of an 800-MHz (18.79 T) HTS insert (H800) comprising 3 nested stacks of DP coils wound with GdBCO tape, that together with a 500-MHz (11.74 T) LTS NMR magnet (L500) available at the FBML, will generate a field of 30.53 T (1.3 GHz 1H frequency); Aim 2) development, continued from Phase 3A, of innovative field-shimming techniques to convert, after completion of this modified Phase 3B program, the 30.53-T L500/H800 magnet to a high-resolution 1.3 GHz NMR magnet (1.3G) capable of producing 1-Hz linewidths. These new field-shimming techniques are essential for NMR magnets that rely on an HTS insert. To achieve Aim 1 in the most efficient, and affordable, manner, we are applying innovative design concepts to build HTS double-pancake (DP) coils: no-insulation winding technique and inside-notch DP coils. The two new shimming techniques, development of which will be continued as Aim 2 in this modified Phase 3B program are persistent-mode HTS shims and ?shaking-field? magnet. Upon successful completion of our 1.3G, it will be installed in the MIT-Harvard Center for Magnetic Resonance at the FBML. We believe that our 1.3G will become a vital force in high-field NMR and will serve the entire NMR community in the U.S. for decades to come and have a worldwide impact on medical sciences. Modified Specific Aims The successful completion of an 800-MHz (18.79 T) HTS insert (H800) comprising 3 nested stacks of DP coils wound with GdBCO tape, is one of the Specific Aims of this modified Phase 3B program. The H800 will be combined with a 500-MHz (11.74 T) LTS NMR magnet (L500) presently available at the FBML. In this modified Phase 3B program we will also continue development, initiated in Phase 3A, of new field shimming techniques. After completion of this modified Phase 3B program, we will apply the shimming techniques to the H800, thereby converting the resultant 30.53-T LTS/HTS magnet to a high-resolution 1.3-GHz NMR magnet (1.3G). The key benefits of a 1.3-GHz magnet are higher resolution and sensitivity. This enables the examination of complex molecular systems such as proteins and nucleic acids in a much shorter time, or with smaller quantities of material. This modified Phase 3B program has two specific aims: 1) successful completion of H800, that together with L500 will generate a field of 30.53 T and a 1H frequency of 1.3 GHz; 2) development, continued from Phase 3A, of field-shimming techniques to convert, after completion of this modified Phase 3B program, the 30.53-T L500/H800 magnet to a high-resolution 1.3 GHz NMR magnet (1.3G) capable of producing 1-Hz linewidths. These new field shimming techniques are essential for NMR magnets that rely on HTS tape conductor. As discussed further in 3. Research & Strategy, to achieve Aim 1 in the most efficient, and affordable manner, we are applying innovative design concepts to build HTS DP coils: no-insulation winding technique and inside-notch DP coils. To ensure the highest possible probability to achieve Aim 2 we have initiated in Phase 3A, and to continue in this modified Phase 3B program, development of two innovative field shimming techniques: persistent-mode HTS shims and ?shaking-field? magnet. As also discussed in 3. Research & Strategy, an L500/H800 combination is considerably less expensive than a combination of a <4.2-K operated 900-MHz LTS magnet (L900) and a 400- MHz HTS insert (H400)?this will become a reality when the HTS insert becomes standard for a >1-GHz NMR magnet. Moreover, because the footprint of a >1-GHz LTS/HTS magnet is essentially determined by that of the LTS component, space-wise our L500/H800 combination is more efficient, and certainly desirable, than an L900/H400 combination.

,9339720,"?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Major hemorrhage on anticoagulants is a dramatic presentation that creates a bias against restarting the anticoagulant for fear of precipitating another hemorrhage. What often gets lost in this one-sided assessment of risk is the underlying threat of thromboembolic disease, for which the patient was anticoagulated to begin with. A more balanced approach between the risk of hemorrhage and stroke and prospective randomized data on which to base it is direly needed. This proposal is relevant to the mission of NHLBI as it deals with heart disease, since the most common indication for oral anticoagulation is atrial fibrillation. It deals with blood disease, albeit an iatrogenic coagulopathy caused by anticoagulation therapy. It deals with the clinical setting of bleeding, both in gastrointestinal bleeding and intracranial hemorrhage. It aims to enhance the health of patients with these diseases by studying the risk/benefit of restarting anticoagulation after major hemorrhage. Its goals are immediately translational into clinical practice. It fosters training and mentoring of an emerging scientist and physician, and it creates and supports a robust, collaborative research infrastructure in partnership with the private non-profit Seton Healthcare Family and the new University of Texas Dell Medical School in Austin. There are no evidence-based guidelines on when to restart warfarin after major hemorrhage, much less the Novel Oral Anticoagulants (NOACs) increasingly being used. The overall goal of this application is to elucidate a research plan to inform the clinical decision to restart anticoagulation after major hemorrhage that will establish Dr. Milling as an independent impactful researcher in this field. Dr. Milling will enrollin a formal master's degree program: Masters of Science in Clinical Investigations at the University of Texas Health Science Center - San Antonio. He will also undergo extensive and immersive training in hemostasis and coagulation, the design and conduct of multicenter clinical trials, conceptual training in the field of adaptive trial design, and health economics. Dr. Milling will receive careful mentorship from Drs. Steven Warach, Scott Berry Todd Olmstead and Jerrold Levy utilizing both formal training curriculum and informal meeting frameworks to draw from their extensive and diverse experience and guidance. Dr. Milling will conduct a three-phased research design, including the development of a National Practice Survey Tool for Clinical Trials (survey of patients, PCPs, and Cardiologists), laying the ground work for a larger multicenter, adaptive, time dose clinical trial and a future R01 submission, to find the ideal time to restart oral anticoagulants after a major hemorrhage that balances the risk of recurrent hemorrhage with the risk of thromboembolic disease.", ,,,
,9339325,"Project Summary Georgia Food and Feed Rapid Response Team The overall mission of the Georgia Food and Feed Rapid Response Team (GA RRT) is to characterize, investigate, mitigate, and conclude food and feed emergencies as a part of a coordinated federal-state- local integrated food safety system. This project will allow Georgia to continually develop, improve, and sustain the mission and resources of the GA RRT. Since the original cooperative agreement in 2012, Georgia has built and strengthened an integrated and multiagency response team not only within the state, but state to state, and engages all appropriate federal, state, local, and tribal stakeholders. These stakeholders include representatives from both agriculture, environmental health, epidemiology, laboratories, law enforcement and many more. During the past three years, the GA RRT has been heavily involved in developing and revising best practice guidelines, standard operating procedures, and memorandums of understanding to build and strengthen the state?s capability and capacity to respond to food and feed emergencies. As a result, the state is now better prepared for a public health response to a number of scenarios where the public at risk. This includes the consequences of natural disasters, unintentional contaminations, and intentional contaminations or acts of bioterrorism. One of the major goals the GA RRT intends to build upon is the continual use of a coordinated, standardized, and integrated incident management team to respond to food and feed outbreaks and emergencies. The GA RRT plans to refine and improve this process and develop multi-state approaches to conducting post- response activities including developing after-action reports and improvement plans. The GA RRT intends to expand its resources to both neighboring RRT and non-RRT states. We will further this response capability by strengthening the regional preparedness component by continuing to actively engage and mentor the Southeastern states. The relationship developed during the original cooperative agreement will be built upon and will grow stronger. Several projects including the recently reestablished surge capacity workgroup and a future EMAC exercise will be completed to support the RRT Mission Ready Packages. Additionally, other multi-state and national initiatives including a food defense and recovery workshop will be developed and shared with RRT and non-RRT funded states. Another important goal of the GA RRT is to continue to operate within phase 3 of the original grant and to continually maintain, train, and equip the team. In collaboration with the Georgia Department of Public Health, the local and district health departments will undergo training and will be engaged appropriately during responses activities such as recall effectiveness checks. Developing a procedure and identifying information sharing restrictions will be a major deliverable in enhancing and improving this collaboration.", ,,,
,9278726,"Our R25T Training Program in Cancer-related Population Sciences, a joint effort of Columbia's Mailman School of Public Health and Herbert Irving Comprehensive Cancer Center (HICCC), is now completing its 14th year and will not be eligible for renewal; thus, we submit this competitive renewal for an equivalent T32 grant. Funded continuously since 1985 by NCI T32 and R25T grants, we have provided multidisciplinary training to 45 predoctoral and 70 postdoctoral trainees. Most of them have developed successful academic careers, and many are now leaders in cancer epidemiology, biostatistics, carcinogenesis, survivorship and health outcomes research nationally. Since 2002, our R25T program has had 30 trainees. In its current cycle (2012-2017), it hosts 4 postdoctoral research fellows annually across 3 public health disciplines, supported by 19 R01-funded primary mentors and 24 secondary mentors. The average NIH grant portfolio of our primary mentors is $1.9 million/year. Past R25 trainees have published a mean of 8.75 papers with a mean of 3.5 first authored, and 20 out of 22 trainees from the last 10 years remain in research. We also have an outstanding applicant pool; 73% of applicants are training grant eligible; 18% selectivity; and 20% of trainees from underrepresented racial/ethnic groups. This competitive renewal reports on new leadership at Mailman, the participating departments, and the NCI-funded HICCC, all of whom are deeply committed to ensuring the longstanding success of our Training Program and our fellows. Mailman provides salary support for the two PIs and part- time administrative assistant as well as space and support for the trainees. Our location in northern Manhattan, including Washington Heights and Harlem with their large underserved minority populations, and our close relationships with the New York City Department of Health, made us early leaders in disparities research, and our trainees benefit tremendously from those resources. In addition, our large portfolio of international collaborative projects, together with our catchment area studies, provides our fellows with a global perspective on cancer and the changing dynamics of the cancer epidemic, which is best understood through contrasts in study populations and exposures. Our leadership in health outcomes research and survivorship, as well as the emerging field of cancer care delivery research (CCDR) has gained us a large number of fellows in medical, pediatric, surgical and gynecologic oncology as trainees. We offer training modules in study design, clinical, behavioral, laboratory, health services, and data analysis. Our program also includes weekly journal clubs, biweekly seminars, a formal evaluation protocol, and mock study sections. We regularly interact with our External Advisory Board and invite them to visit annually to meet our fellows and hear about their research. A collaboration of epidemiology, biostatistics, and environmental health sciences, including clinical and laboratory training opportunities, our program offers a superb multidisciplinary, multidimensional milieu in which trainees can develop their research skills and find their own niches.", ,,,
,9349345,"?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Iron deficiency (ID) is associated with cardiovascular events such as stroke in children and cardiovascular disease (CVD) and all-cause mortality in adulthood. However, it is unknown whether ID in infancy contributes to the development of CVD and metabolic syndrome (cardio-metabolic risk). Studies of developmental effects of early ID demonstrate long-term negative effects on cognitive functioning, behavior, and socio-emotional development. Such changes may affect health behaviors that increase cardio-metabolic risk. Early adversity (e.g., poverty, maltreatment) is linked to higher cardio-metabolic risk and might also operate through similar cognitive, behavioral, and socio-emotional pathways. As ID is more common in low SES and other disadvantaged circumstances, a yet untested hypothesis is that there is a dual burden of having both ID and early adverse experiences that negatively affects functioning and subsequently increases cardio-metabolic risk. The goal of this project is to understand pathways between early ID and adversity and adult cardio-metabolic risk in order to identify targets for prevention and intervention and to detect subgroups at highest risk for disruptions in functioning and cardio-metabolic health. This goal will be accomplished using data from a large longitudinal study (n > 1000) of the effects of ID from infancy to early adulthood (PIs: Betsy Lozoff and Sheila Gahagan). Information on early ID and adversity (SES, life stress, maternal depression, father absence), adolescent cognitive functioning, health behaviors, and mental health, and adult cardio-metabolic risk (BMI, fat mass, blood pressure, blood lipids, hormonal regulators of metabolism) will be utilized. The first aim will test whether there are indirect effects of early ID on adult cardio-metabolic risk through pathways related to adolescent cognitive functioning, health behaviors, and mental health. The second aim will examine whether early adversity affects cardio-metabolic risk through similar or different pathways. The third aim will examine whether the dual burden of ID and adversity further increases cardio-metabolic risk in adulthood through these adolescent pathways. These aims will be accomplished with a training plan emphasizing the neurobiological and behavioral effects of early ID (sponsor Lozoff), childhood influences on cardio-metabolic risk (co-sponsor Gahagan), early adversity (Lozoff and Gahagan), and advanced statistical methods. Completing this research and training will be the first step in the PI's career plan to conduct policy-relevant research on the impact of nutrition and adversity on mental and physical health throughout the lifespan.", ,,,
,9355622,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Somatosensory neurons that innervate the skin and muscle play an essential role in sensing touch, pain, and proprioception. The same type of sensory neurons innervates other organs that experience frequent mechanical stimulation. This list of such organs/tissues includes bone, teeth, lung, vasculature, stomach, and bladder. Anatomically, cranial ganglia (including trigeminal) innervate the head, while nodose/jugular and dorsal root ganglia (DRG) innervate the rest of the body. The role of the mechanically activated (MA) non-selective cation channel Piezo2 in DRGs for sensing touch and proprioception is well established. However, much less is known about the role of Piezo2 (and mechanotransduction in general) in other sensory ganglia that innervate the craniofacial region and other internal organs. For example, repetitive and wide-ranging mechanical forces are experienced by our respiratory system. Lung stretch is sensed by neurons with their cell bodies in the nodose/jugular, trigeminal, and thoracic DRGs. Mechanically-driven reflexes are thought to be crucial for proper lung function; however, the precise physiological significance and molecular mechanism of mechanotransduction within the lung remains obscure. In preliminary data presented in this proposal, we show that Piezo2 is expressed in neurons innervating the airways. We further show that global and sensory neuronspecific ablation of Piezo2 causes symptoms of respiratory distress. Building on the preliminary data presented here, we will investigate the role of Piezo2 in respiration and in various craniofacial tissues.", ,,,
,9380895,"?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of this project is to use new advances in cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) technology to elucidate the structures of, at high-resolution, a range of functional states of ionotropic glutamate receptor (iGluR) ion channels, and to use complementary functional and biochemical assays to validate our findings and hypotheses driven by our solved cryo-EM models. iGluRs are responsible for the majority of excitatory neurotransmission, and are implicated in a wide range of pathologies, from neurodegenerative diseases and psychiatric disorders, to epilepsy and stroke-induced trauma. Current design of therapeutics targeting the range of iGluR functional states that dictate these different disease states is hindered by a lack of information describing iGluRs outside of a closed-channel state. This research will directly address the need for new views into these functional states by using cryo-EM based methods, which will allow crystallographic barriers in analyzing iGluR states to be overcome. Using state-of-the-art cryo-EM techniques, high-resolution cryo-EM of iGluRs will be established. With fluorescence-based construct screening strategies, new targets for isolating separate structural states in iGluR function will be identified. Namely, how auxiliary proteins interact with/regulate iGluRs and iGluR gating will be targeted. After cryo-EM analysis, data will be probed using advanced electrophysiological techniques and biochemical interrogation. The methods used in this project will serve as a foundation for investigating functional states across ion channel families, and may provide a much-needed template for structure-based drug design of new molecules targeting iGluR states.", ,,,
,9382193,"Precise control of gene transcription patterns, mediated by chromatin structural changes, is essential for cell identity preservation that is disrupted in cancer cells. The CoREST complex, a multi-protein complex of histone-modifying enzymes, functions as a transcriptional co-repressor by facilitating formation of repressive chromatin. The CoREST complex contains two key histone modifying enzymes, lysine-specific histone demethylase 1 (LSD1) and histone deacetylase 1 and 2 (HDAC1 and HDAC2) held together by the CoREST scaffolding protein. These enzymes are typically up-regulated in cancer, suggesting the CoREST complex is a specific target for cancer therapy. The goal of this proposed study is to molecularly define the CoREST complex as a therapeutic target for cancer. We recently developed a small molecule inhibitor (corin2) of the CoREST complex. Corin2 is a dual inhibitor of LSD1 and HDACs1/2 in the CoREST complex and shows high potency anti-proliferative effects against many cancer cell types when screened against the NCI 60 panel, with particular efficacy versus human melanomas. Our preliminary data suggests that the CoREST complex activates c-MYC/E2F-stimulated target genes associated with cell cycle progression and proliferation. In contrast, genes encoding the BMP/SMAD membrane-bound ligand-dependent nuclear receptors, which are known for promoting cellular differentiation, are transcriptionally silenced by the CoREST complex. The anti- proliferative role of the TGF-?/BMP-mediated SMAD signaling pathway is well documented; however, this function is often lost in many cancer cells. Here, we hypothesize that the CoREST complex induces disruption of BMP/SMAD driven anti-proliferative/differentiation signals resulting in increased transcriptional activation of the MYC/E2F-dependent proliferation gene network. In this way, blocking the CoREST/MYC proliferative gene transcription network circuit is expected to be an effective strategy in cancer. To test this hypothesis, we will perform the following aims using melanoma as a target cancer model: 1) analyze genome-wide effects of corin2 to discover the CoREST complex target gene signature and its correlation with the c-MYC/E2F target transcription network, 2) define the role of the CoREST complex in BMP/SMAD signaling and the switch from a differentiation/tumor- suppressive phenotype to cell growth phenotype, 3) evaluate corin2 as an epigenetic anti-tumor agent by targeting the transcriptional regulatory mechanisms of the c-MYC/E2F transcription network. To accomplish these aims, we will use the small molecule CoREST inhibitor, corin2, as well as a series of chemically-related analogs; a genetically engineered mouse melanoma model; and human melanoma tissue specimens. These proposed studies will extend our knowledge of the chromatin repressive CoREST complex and its roles in regulating a cell proliferative gene transcription network. In this manner, this proposal will provide a mechanistic rationale for the development of a novel therapeutic strategy targeting epigenetic malignancy-associated pathways in melanoma and other cancers.", ,,,
,9332349,"?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Prostate cancer is the most common cancer in men. In the US, 1 in 7 men will experience a prostate cancer diagnosis in his lifetime. Identifying ways to reduce the burden of prostate cancer is therefore a top research priority. Management of prostate cancer has changed dramatically since the advent and widespread dissemination of the PSA test. Since the early 1990s, prostate cancer mortality in the US has dropped by almost half. The CISNET Prostate Working Group (PWG) was formed to use disease modeling to explain these mortality trends. The CISNET PWG has developed three models of prostate cancer natural history, detection, and survival and calibrated them against US prostate cancer trends. Results indicate that both screening and treatment changes have reduced prostate cancer deaths. However, policies must be tailored to limit harms and costs associated with overdiagnosis and overtreatment. Different approaches for doing this have been proposed but cannot all be investigated in prospective studies. The objective of this application is to utilize and extend the CISNET PWG models to identify tailored and targeted intervention strategies that offer the most benefit while limiting harms and costs. We will determine whether we can improve screening further by using novel stratification approaches and also whether we can safely limit harms of overtreatment by judicious choices of primary and secondary therapies. These approaches will be applied in the US population and in international cancer control settings that may require modified strategies. We will provide decision makers with model access via online calculators with graphical user interfaces. Our specific aims are: Aim 1: Identify active surveillance strategies that minimize patient burden without increasing risks of progression to non-curable disease or death. Aim 2: Develop stratified approaches to prostate cancer screening that target high-risk men based on polygenic risk and baseline PSA at age 45. Aim 3: Model secondary treatment strategies, their impact, and implications for population prostate cancer control. Aim 4: Determine whether racial disparities in prostate cancer mortality can be reduced by using stratified screening and treatment strategies. Aim 5: Modularize models to evaluate cancer control programs in non-US populations and collaborate with investigators in the UK and the Caribbean to develop policies for their populations and resources. Aim 6: Develop online calculators to support patient-physician decisions and policymaker deliberations about PSA screening and treatment for localized prostate cancer. These aims are highly responsive to the funding opportunity announcement, addressing 6 of the 9 targeted priority areas. Our cumulative expertise in prostate modeling, our existing models, and our close ties with clinical experts who provide access to large, high-quality datasets for model validation and calibration position us well to uniquely contribute to the national and international dialogue about how best to address and control this most common cancer in men.", ,,,
,9283528,"?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Promoting Utilization of Kidneys by Improving Organ Acceptance Decision Making Only 15,652 of nearly 109,000 waitlisted patients for kidney transplant (KT) received one in 2014. More than six thousand died while waiting for a KT and more than two thousand became too sick to be transplanted. Patient survival, quality of life, and morbidity is significantly worse for those who remain on dialysis. The majority of kidneys that are transplanted are recovered from deceased donors. In 2014, while 12,664 kidneys were recovered for KT, 2,272 were discarded - most frequently due to being of marginal or low quality. Many of the discarded kidneys are believed to confer smaller survival gains than other procured kidneys. Previous studies show that the marginal kidneys offer survival benefits with respect to remaining on dialysis, but neglect quantification of these benefits to an individual patient. These studies ignore two major issues: (i) the low c-statistics of one and three year post-transplant patient and graft survival models; and (ii) dynamics of the organ offers and the current point based priority system for the waitlisted patients. Given these facts, from a decision maker's perspective, accepting or rejecting a low quality organ is not necessarily a well informed choice.  The proposed research takes a comprehensive approach in developing a survival model incorporating time on dialysis, recipient characteristics, transplant center characteristics, and donated kidney characteristics. It proposes to apply techniques from biostatistics and machine learning to improve model accuracy. The research further aims to quantify the dynamics of kidney availability of different quality organs, and model future kidney offers as a stochastic decision tree. The proposed computational engine for estimating the survival benefits of accepting or rejecting an offer will be transformative in clinical decision making. Moreover, th successful completion of the proposed research will provide a highly reliable approach to support kidney acceptance/rejection decisions. The research will be carried out by a trans- disciplinary team with expert knowledge in the transplant allocation system, decision methodologies, and clinical decision making. The research team will incorporate input from an external advisory board consisting of leaders and key stakeholders in kidney and pancreas transplant programs.", ,,,
,9396090,"ABSTRACT Nephrotic syndrome is the most common form of kidney disease in children, responsible for up to 20% of kidney failures in pediatric patients, and approximately 12% of all causes of kidney failures across different age groups. Treating kidney failure cost the United States over $40 billion in public and private funds in 2009 and has been more expensive every year.  Nephrotic syndrome is a relapsing form of kidney disease that presents with massive leak of serum proteins into the urine or proteinuria resulting in low serum albumin levels or hypoalbuminemia, edema, dysregulation of lipid homeostasis, hypertension, risk of infection, thrombosis, and kidney failure. Nephrotic syndrome constitutes tremendous psychological and social burden for patients and their families. Current therapeutic options display variable and unsatisfactory efficacy affected by heterogeneity of causes, medication cost, and medication side effects. Management of pediatric nephrotic was established by the International Study of Kidney Disease in Children in the 1960s and 1970s. Published data demonstrate the phenotypic presentation of nephrotic syndrome has been changing and the severity has been increasing over the years. In spite, management strategies of nephrotic syndrome have changed very little during the same time. Data on novel mutations, diagnostic tools, disease biomarkers and treatment strategies, as well as innovative monitoring strategies appear every month in peer-reviewed scientific journals. Thus, there is a critical need for continuing education and a great need for strengthening collaborative efforts between research and clinical groups to improve understanding of causes and optimize management strategies in nephrotic syndrome by implementing results of the cutting-edge research. Dr. Urban has been organizing the Pittsburgh Nephrotic Syndrome Symposium yearly since 2014. The 4th Pittsburgh Nephrotic Syndrome Symposium: Focus on Evidence-Based and Personalized Approach will be held at the Rangos Conference Center at the Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh of UPMC, University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania on September 28th and September 29th 2017. The specific aims of the 4th symposium are: (1) to present up-to-date information on the etiology, diagnostic tools, biomarkers, monitoring, and treatment of nephrotic syndrome; (2) to promote cutting edge research on nephrotic syndrome and foster cross- communication between the most promising junior investigators and trainees who will carry the research and discovery torch to the future generations; (3) to close the gap between research and the day-to-day care of patients with nephrotic syndrome; (4) to educate general practitioners and allied professionals about current issues in nephrotic syndrome; and (5) to share the most up-to-date, evidence-based information on nephrotic syndrome with patients and families.", ,,,
,9312658,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Spina Bifida (SB), a group of congenital conditions caused by malformations in the neural tube development early in pregnancy, is one of the most common disabling conditions in our country today. These conditions result in a wide range of spinal cord and central nervous system impairments that affect many body systems. Further complicating the care of persons with SB is the absence of knowledge regarding the prevalence or severity of the potential health issues across clinical programs and the significant variance in health outcomes. The National Spina Bifida Patient Registry (NSBPR) was developed to address this gap. The overall goal of this project is improving the care of individuals living with SB. Our continued active participation in the NSBPR will address this goal. The project has two aims. The first aim is to extend participation in the core components of the NSBPR. Specifically, over the next five years we will collect and submit NSBPR data from 200 enrolled and actively maintained participants with SB in the SB Programs at Children's Hospital of Wisconsin and its collaborating adult clinics at the Froedtert Memorial Lutheran Hospital/Medical College of Wisconsin. Further, we will participate in data quality assessments, provide basic data on eligible patients who are not enrolled in the NSBPR, implement the evaluation and dissemination plans and participate in the NSBPR Coordinating Committee. The second aim addresses expansion of the research activities. Specifically, we will generate two research questions/hypotheses for NSBPR data, develop the research plan with collaborators both within Wisconsin programs and across the NSBPR sites, and disseminate findings and translate the findings of NSBPR analyses to practice. Finally, we will develop and pilot test select additional components that may be useful for expansion of the NSBPR. The two research studies included in this proposal are, Factors Predicting Pressure Ulcers in Children and Adults with Spina Bifida and Measuring Body Composition in Children with Spina Bifida. Our site will continue to use the data collection instrument developed by the NSBPR (V2) for data collection and entry. Data is entered through a web-based system and primarily de-identified data are provided to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Analyses of the NSBPR data will be guided by the Coordinating Committee of NSBPR sites and involve clinicians from the participating sites working with statisticians and scientists from CDC. A detailed dissemination plan for consumers and professionals is included in this proposal. The expanded participation of the Wisconsin site in the NSBPR proposed in this application is expected to have a positive impact on the care of persons with SB. Further, it will provide a foundation for research that expands our understanding of the condition and its treatment. The outcome of this project is a database that can be used to describe variations in practice across settings, facilitate data analyses that s the basis for best practices in clinical care, and improves quality across programs.", ,,,
,9333161,"Abstract This is a competing renewal of a postdoctoral training program entitled Training in Investigative Infectious Diseases based in the Section of Infectious Diseases, Department of Internal Medicine at the Yale School of Medicine. The aims of this training program are to: (a) develop the next generation of Infectious Disease investigators trained in translational research (b) develop new prevention and therapeutic strategies for infectious diseases of national and international significance and (c) advance the principles associated with high quality research including adherence to ethical principles. The program is designed for physicians with an MD, MD-PhD, DO or equivalent degree. Most trainees will be Fellows in Infectious Diseases, but selected M.D.s or MD-PhDs with clinical training in other fields will also be eligible to participate. The highly accomplished training faculty has four broadly defined areas of research: (1) Innate Immunity and Microbes, (2) Vector-borne Diseases, (3) Molecular and Human Infectious Disease Pathogenesis, and (4) Clinical and Epidemiologic Infectious Disease Research. Detailed plans for trainee admission to the program, mentor and mentorship committee selection, and evaluation of trainee progress are in place. In addition to outstanding research training, Yale has opportunities for study toward advanced degrees such as a Masters in Health Science or PhD in Investigative Medicine that are open to physicians in the T32 training program. Extensive didactic training is also available through the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, School of Public Health and the Yale National Clinician Scholars Program. This combination of outstanding research opportunities, didactic coursework and seminar series, and career development training in grant writing and presentation skills has resulted in a high level of programmatic success in training physician-investigators at Yale who choose research careers in academia or industry. At the same time, the T32 Infectious Diseases training program at Yale continues to evolve and improve, with the addition of new training faculty with interests in global health, enhanced recruitment of MD-PhD physician-scientists, a plan to enhance underrepresented minority fellowship recruitment that includes a common ?second look? visit for minority applicants to fellowships throughout the entire Department of Internal Medicine, and improvements in career development activities designed to facilitate mentor selection, increase interactions with the diverse and accomplished training faculty and provide training in leadership and negotiation skills. We believe these changes will further enhance the ability of our trainees to contribute high impact, new knowledge in Infectious Disease.", ,,,
,9360095,"ABSTRACT  There are 2.5 million Americans who abuse or are dependent on opioids. Methadone maintenance treatment (MMT) is the most common treatment for opioid dependence. While MMT has been effective in improving drug use outcomes, the overwhelming majority continue to engage in unhealthy lifestyles (e.g., physical inactivity) that lead to significant mental and physical health morbidities such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes, hypertension, obesity, depression, sleep difficulties, and cognitive impairments. Given the mental and physical health benefits of physical activity (PA), interventions targeting increases in PA in MMT patients could have a significant impact on reducing the overall morbidity and mortality.  The purpose of this study is to develop a feasible, acceptable and effective multilevel PA intervention that addresses both individual and interpersonal factors delivered in the context of a health care setting (i.e., methadone clinics). To do so, we are proposing to train MMT patients who are already engaging in PA at public health recommended levels to deliver a group-based PA intervention to physically inactive MMT patients at a large community-based methadone clinic. An increasing number of peer-facilitated PA interventions have been found to effectively increase and sustain physical activity levels, though none in substance abusing populations. Peers may play a particularly important role in increasing physical activity in MMT, as this population faces unique and significant barriers to PA (e.g., depression, smoking, triggers for drug use in environment). MMT peers who have successfully navigated through these barriers and are physically active can share information, help in problem solving barriers, act as role models, and offer support and encouragement, thereby helping inactive MMT patients increase self-efficacy and motivation for sustaining PA.  The design of this study takes place in 2 phases -- the R21 phase will be focused on the development of a peer-facilitated PA+Fitbit intervention (Peer-PA+Fitbit), while the R33 phase will evaluate the efficacy of Peer- PA+Fitbit in an RCT. The R21 phase will consist of: 1) focus groups with potential peers and physically inactive MMT patients; 2) development of a PA manual that integrates use of the Fitbit; 3) developing a training protocol for peers; 4) identifying safe, walkable paths in participant neighborhoods, and 5) a 12-week open pilot trial (n=20) to test the feasibility and acceptability of the Peer-PA+Fitbit intervention. The R33 Phase will involve randomizing 150 patients currently receiving MMT to one of three arms: 1) Peer-PA+Fitbit intervention, 2) contact control wellness groups (Well+Fitbit), and 3) Usual Care (UC). Follow-up assessments will be conducted at 3, 6, & 12-months to determine both the short- and long-term adherence to physical activity. We expect that this project will lead to the development of a scalable, multilevel peer-facilitated PA intervention tailored to patients in MMT, thereby improving the overall health and well-being of this at-risk population.", ,,,
,9331654,"?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Specification of organ/tissue identity is a fundamental requirement of animal development as it is imperative that each tissue/organ type be made in the right numbers, placed in the right location and constructed to function properly. The traditional view of this process has been that gene regulatory networks function exclusively to promote the desired fate. However, a growing body of evidence, including several discoveries from my research group, strongly suggests that determination of organ and tissue identity actually has two requirements: 1) specifying the desired tissue and 2) repressing alternate fates. A situation where this paradigm-shifting model is likely to be particularly valuable is in establishing boundaries between distinct tissue types. In this respect eye development provides an ideal opportunity to test our new models of tissue specification. In Drosophila, several non-ocular structures such as the head epidermis, antenna, and maxillary palp border the developing fly retina. We examined sine oculis (so) and eyes absent (eya) mutant retinas and have determined that selector genes normally expressed in the surrounding non-ocular tissues are ectopically activated in the eye field. Activation of these factors within retinal progenitor clls forces a homeotic transformation of the eye field into epidermal tissue. The vertebrate eye similarly arises from a territory that is bordered by non-ocular tissues including the telencephalon, diencephalon, and hypothalamus. Recent studies have shown that several selector genes controlling their development are also ectopically activated in the eyes of mouse Lhx2 and frog rax mutants. The transformations that are seen in both vertebrates and flies indicate that segregation of ocular and non-ocular fates is essential for proper head and eye formation. The objective of this proposal is to determine how Sine Oculis Homeobox (SIX) and Eyes Absent (EYA) proteins promote eye formation by repressing non-ocular fates in the developing retina. The rationale for the proposed research is that the chosen questions are focused on processes that are likely to be highly conserved, thereby allowing studies in Drosophila to uncover general mechanisms of tissue/organ formation. Exciting preliminary data guides the following specific aims: (1) Investigate the role that SIX/EYA proteins play in the novel suppression of non-ocular fates during eye specification; (2) Test the hypothesis that retinal patterning by the morphogenetic furrow requires suppression of non-ocular fates by Dpp signaling and SIX/EYA proteins; and (3) Identify the molecular mechanism by which eya expression is activated in the eye field and repressed in bordering non-ocular tissues. The proposed studies test innovative hypotheses and are significant because our results will uncover new far-reaching principles governing tissue/organ specification and patterning. The work also will further our understanding of how errors in these processes facilitate the induction of congenital disorders.", ,,,
,9537218,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Approximately 50% of Americans, age 30 and over, have periodontal disease. As periodontal disease progresses, inflammation can ultimately lead to irreversible bone and tooth loss. Mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) modulate the innate host inflammatory response during periodontal disease. Mitogen- activated protein kinase-activated protein kinase 2 (MK2), a downstream target of p38 MAPK, regulates inflammation in macrophages in aggressive periodontal disease animal models. Both macrophages and osteoclasts are derived from a monocyte lineage that expresses surface chemokine receptors critical for chemotaxis from circulation to peripheral sites of infection. Previous results from our project laboratory show that A. actinomycetemcomitans, an aggressive periodontal disease pathogen, and A. actinomycetemcomitans lipopolysaccharide (LPS) activate MK2. In an A. actinomycetemcomitans LPS-driven rat model, MK2 positively regulates inflammatory infiltration and bone loss. Preliminary data support a role for MK2 as a regulator of CXCR4 cell surface expression on CD11bhi-expressing cells, suggesting modulation of chemokine receptor expression may be an important mechanism of decreasing macrophage infiltrates under MK2 inhibition. MK2 signaling is critical for pathologic osteoclastogenesis, as supported by a decrease in LPS-driven osteoclast formation in Mk2-/- CD11blo osteoclast progenitor cells (OCPs) compared to Mk2+/+ (WT). In vivo, MK2 signaling was also critical for A. actinomycetemcomitans-induced bone loss in a murine calvarial model. These data support our hypothesis that MK2 signaling is required for monocyte chemotaxis and subsequent differentiation into macrophages and osteoclasts during host-pathogen interactions. To address the hypothesis, we will use bone marrow transplant to create MK2 chimeric animals followed by an air pouch model to assess the role of hematopoietic MK2 signaling in monocyte chemotaxis under A. actinomycetemcomitans challenge (Aim #1). The mechanism of MK2 signaling in A. actinomycetemcomitans- induced osteoclastogenesis with regards to NFATc1, the master transcription factor of osteoclastogenesis, will be studied in vitro using OCPs. The murine calvarial bone loss model will be used to confirm that MK2 is critical for A. actinomycetemcomitans driven osteoclastogenesis in vivo (Aim #2). This proposed research will support delineation of the impact of MK2 signaling on monocyte migration to the site of local periodontal disease infection and further differentiation into macrophages and osteoclasts.", ,,,

PROJECT SUMMARY (See Instmctions): The Case CCC Hematopoietic Stem Cell Core provides for the procurement, processing, production. Storage, banking, analysis and distribution of cells derived from human blood, bone marrow, and umbilical cords. The Core is composed of two components: 1) A human hematopoietic biorepository and support services to facilitate basic hematopoietic research, and 2) A cellular therapy facility that supports clinical grade cell manufacturing for investigational and standard-of-care therapy. The biorepository procures, processes, banks and distributes human cells from a variety of sources for researchers under an Institutional Review Board (IRB)-approved protocol. This facility obviates the need for Cancer Center members to invest in specialized stem cell reagents and procedures as well as the need to identify and procure blood or bone marrow samples from normal donors and patients with specific hematologic disorders The cellular therapy component of the Core, designated as the Cellular Therapy Service, supports clinical cellular therapy activities from the preclinical phase through clinical trial implementation. While the heaviest use of the Core is by members of the Hematopoietic Disorders Program, the Core has supported work in 6 of the 8 Research Programs of the Cancer Center. In particular, the Core supported work that: investigated the efficacy of novel leukemia therapeutics identified on human AML patient samples as well as determining their myelotoxic effects on normal bone marrow; identified that the combination of fludarabine plus MX represents a potential new clinical targeted therapy; and uses human MSCs to devise a novel model on the trophic and immunomodulatory properties of MSCs that may have important implications in cancer.", ,,,
,9337455,"?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Retinal vascular dysfunction and degeneration are the early characteristics of diabetic retinopathy (DR). Compelling evidence suggests that the chronic diabetic milieu damages retinal endothelial cells and pericytes, resulting in loss of retinl capillaries. At the late stages, extensive capillary dropout leads to severe reduction in blood supply and defects in oxygen delivery to the neural retina. This, in turn, stimulates retinal expression and production of pro-angiogenic factors, which promote vascular leakage and new vessel growth leading to retinal edema and proliferative retinopathy. Clearly, retinal endothelial injury, if irreversibly leading to consequent capillary loss, is a central event in the development and progression of DR. However, to date, there is no effective therapy available to prevent diabetes-induced retinal vascular damage. The goal of our project is to address this critical gap by identifying and harnessing endogenous protective factors to enhance retinal cell survival and improve vascular function in diabetes mellitus. Our published and preliminary studies have revealed one such protective factor, namely X-box binding protein 1 (XBP1). XBP1 is a transcription factor in the core signaling pathways of the unfolded protein response (UPR) and is broadly implicated in ER biogenesis, protein folding, immune response, and lipid metabolism. Our data confirmed a fundamental role of the XBP1- mediated UPR in maintaining endothelial cell homeostasis against inflammation. In addition, we found that XBP1-null retinal cells are sensitive to oxidative damage and apoptosis. Strikingly, our new results suggest a novel function of XBP1 in regulation of mitochondrial remodeling and activity. Thus, we hypothesize that XBP1 is a central regulator of cell adaptation to diabetic stressors through coordinating ER and mitochondrial homeostasis. We propose 3 Specific Aims to test this hypothesis, focusing on XBP1's role in mitochondrial regulation in retinal endothelial cells. In Aim 1, we will examine if XBP1 is involved in mitochondrial remodeling and whether enhancing XBP1 expression can reverse diabetes-induced deficits in mitochondrial biogenesis. In Aim 2, we then will delineate if XBP1 regulates mitochondrial energy production through modulation of ER- mitochondrial contact and calcium trafficking. Finally, in Aim 3, we will establish whether XBP1 is essential for mitochondrial ROS detoxification, thereby reducing oxidative damage and apoptosis. This application is conceptually and technically innovative in that it will elucidate a novel function o XBP1, a traditional UPR protein induced by ER stress, in regulation of mitochondrial activities, and using novel RNA-seq and proteomic approaches to identify new XBP1-specific target genes and proteins that are critically involved in these processes. This project also has high translational potential by identifying novel therapeutic targets to enhance retinal cell adaptation to diabetic stresses and prevent/reverse retinal damage in diabetes.", ,,,
,9345351,"?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of the proposed project is to develop a novel drug and imaging agent carrier for improved diagnosis and treatment of many diseases, including Coronary Artery Disease (CAD). Current drug delivery methods flood the body without specificity, producing unwanted side effects and limiting the dosage of drugs may be administered safely. Vascular targeting is the design of drug carriers that preferentially accumulate in diseased tissue while protecting the drug from degradation and clearance, thus increasing drug efficiency and decreasing systemic toxicity. Vascular-targeted nanoparticles (VTNPs) are designed to target the endothelium, the barrier between blood flow and diseased tissue that plays an important pathophysiological role in many diseases. Unfortunately, VTNPs get trapped in the core of blood flow and fail to reach the endothelium. Rigid microparticles (MPs), particularly in the 2-3 ?m diameter size range, effectively localize to the vascular wall i blood flow but may cause capillary occlusions. Thus, we propose to develop deformable, protease-degradable, polymer-based hydrogel MPs as a carrier system for the delivery of VTNPs to the vascular wall in CAD. We plan to experimentally explore the VTNP-loaded hydrogel MP system in a variety of ways. First, the physical characteristics of the hydrogel MPs must be optimized for maximal localization to the vessel wall from blood flow, using a parallel plate flow channel, an in vitro model of realistic bulk blood flow. The localization of particles t the endothelium in blood flow will be reported as a function of the stiffness, size, and the chamber wall shear rate. The enzymatic degradation of the particles is built in with peptides that degrade in the presence of MMP-9, a CAD-associated protease present in higher concentrations in diseased endothelium. We will assess protease degradation of the particles in solution and over inflamed endothelium; selective degradation should occur. The hydrogel particles will be evaluated for preferential adhesion to and release of NP cargo over inflamed cells in vitro. Finally, the hydrogel MPs will be evaluated for targeting efficiency in vivo with a mouse model of human CAD using intravital microscopy, aortic dissections and holistic biodistributions. The key hypotheses for this exploratory work are: (1) targeted, deformable PEG hydrogel MPs loaded with VTNPs will localize and adhere to an inflamed endothelial wall from blood flow; (2) degradable cross- linkers within the hydrogel MP matrix can be cleaved to release loaded VTNPs upon contact with up-regulated proteases in CAD-associated inflamed endothelium; (3) these VTNPs can effectively interact with the vascular wall and deliver a payload; (4) deformable MPs are robust enough to traverse capillaries, lowering the risk of vessel occlusion versus to rigid MPs; and (5) hydrogel MPs will localize to areas of inflammation in vivo in mouse models of CAD. The proposed project aims to generally improve upon current non-invasive imaging agent and drug delivery systems for improved quality of life of the patients, minimized need for surgical intervention, and lowered health care costs by improving the early diagnosis and treatment efficacy of CAD.", ,,,
,9350347,"Project Summary Although most Americans wish to die peacefully at home, many die in pain and in the hospital. A quarter of Medicare dollars ? over $100 billion - is spent for patients in their last year of life many are cancer patients. In brief, there is a desperate need for higher quality, more affordable, better patient-centered care for severely ill and dying patients. Effective palliative care for dying and severely ill patients meets this need. Additionally, improvements in the quality of US health care have not equally benefitted low income and minority patients, who remain more likely to have worse health care experiences and outcomes across the spectrum of clinical settings and diseases. Patient navigator programs, in which lay health workers help patients navigate the system, have shown promise for improving quality of care among specific patient populations, but are not widely implemented due to cost and disease-specific content. A less costly, more broadly applicable program would have the potential to improve quality and outcomes for a larger population. The long-term objective of the K08 candidate, Fabian Johnston, MD, MHS, is to improve health care quality, experiences and outcomes for underserved patients by developing and evaluating systems-oriented, family- engaged interventions with potential for broad population impact. This goal is consistent withAHRQ, NCI, and PCORI, priority areas of improving implementation of models of care, utilization of stakeholder engagement, reduction of disparities and improved use of palliative care. To achieve his objective, Dr. Johnston will undertake didactic and experiential training to improve knowledge and skills in four areas: (1) patient navigation; (2) participant-engaged program development and research; (3) comparative effectiveness and stakeholder engagement; and (4) dissemination and implementation science. Dr. Johnston has assembled a mentorship team with expertise in health care quality research, disparities, patient navigation, palliative care, stakeholder engagement and participant-engaged research, to ensure completion of the proposed research and training and successful transition to independence. Dr. Johnston proposes three sequential, innovative projects that build upon his training goals. These projects will contribute to the development and pilot evaluation of a culturally tailored navigation program for African American patients with advanced solid organ malignancies, targeted to the advance care planning, pain management, and hospice referral. The specific aims are: (1) to collaborate with key stakeholders to develop a targeted patient navigation program; (2) to pilot test the culturally tailored patient navigator intervention; and (3) toassess the feasibility, acceptability, cost, and impact of patient navigation as assessed by a vanguard randomized trial among African American patients with advanced malignancies. This proposal is novel in its application of patient navigation to patients in need of palliative care; and in its use of stakeholder engagement to aid in adaptation of navigation into a briefer, less costly intervention to facilitate dissemination.", ,,,
,9341177,"?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): With the advent of whole slide digital scanners, histopathology slides can be digitized into very high-resolution digital images, realizing a new big data stream that can potentially rival omics data in size and complexity. Just as with the analysis of high-throughput genetic and expression data, the application of sophisticated image analytic tools and data pipelines can render the often passive data of digital pathology (DP) archives into a powerful source for: (a) rich quantitative insights into cancer biology and (b) companion diagnostic decision support tools for precision medicine. Digital pathology enabled companion diagnostic tests could yield predictions of cancer risk and aggressiveness in a manner similar to molecular diagnostic tests. However, prior to widespread clinical adoption of DP, extensive evaluation of clinical interpretation of DP imaging (DPI) and accompanying decision support tools needs to be undertaken. Wider acceptance of DPI by the cancer community (clinical and research) is hampered by lack of a publicly available, open access image informatics platform for easily viewing, managing, and quantitatively analyzing DPIs. While some commercial platforms exist for viewing and analyzing DPI data, none of these platforms are freely available. Open source image viewing/management platforms that cater to the radiology (e.g. XNAT) and computational biology communities are typically not conducive to handling very large file sizes as encountered with DPI datasets.  This multi-PI U24 proposal seeks to expand on an existing, freely available pathology image viewer (Sedeen Image Viewer) to create a pathology informatics platform (PIIP) for managing, annotating, sharing, and quantitatively analyzing DPI data. Sedeen was designed as a universal platform for DPI (by addressing several proprietary scanner formats and big data challenges), to provide (1) reliable and useful image annotation tools, and (2) for image registration and analysis of DPI data. Additionally, Sedeen has become an application for cropping large DPIs so that they can be input into programs such as Matlab or ImageJ. Sedeen has been freely available to the public for three years, with over 160 unique users from over 20 countries.  Building on the initial successes of Sedeen and its existing user base, our intent is to massively increase dissemination of DPI and algorithms in the cancer research community and clinical trial efforts, as well as to contribute towards the adoption of a rational and standardized set of DP operational conventions. This unique project will allow end users with different needs and technical backgrounds to seamlessly (a) archive and manage, (b) share, and (c) visualize their DPI data, acquired from different sites, formats, and platforms. The PIIP will provide a unified user interface for third party algorithms (nuclear segmentation, color normalization, biomarker quantification, radiology-pathology fusion) and will allow for algorithmic evaluation upon data arising from a plurality of source sites. By partnering with professional societies, we envision that the PIIP user base will expand to include the oncology, pathology, radiology, and pharmaceutical communities.", ,,,

In particular, research that is conducted to reduce the burdens caused by the racial disparities in cancer incidence requires bioethical guidance. For these reasons, the Bioethics Shared Resource (BESR) is an integral component of this Partnership. For full/pilot projects, the BESR provides consultation and collaborative support regarding ethical issues from design to implementation and assists in the development of grant proposals, abstracts, and manuscripts. In addition to its work supporting the research of Partnership investigators, the BESR enhances the bioethical capabilities of the Partnership participants. This is accomplished by providing education in bioethics to investigators, junior faculty, post-doctoral fellows, medical residents, graduate/undergraduate and medical students, community health advisors, navigators, partners, and other Partnership personnel regarding sound applications of bioethical principles in cancer research. The BESR provides bioethical education through the Research Education Core of the Partnership and, at TU, collaborates in teaching the graduate/undergraduate courses in bioethics in research, health disparities, and health policy.

,9353190,"Project Summary. The separation of membranes into discrete compartments through the process of membrane fission is essential for diverse cellular processes ranging from cell division to viral entry. While the specialized fission machine dynamin is well-known to induce fission through constriction of membrane tubes, recent evidence shows that other proteins drive fission by previously unknown mechanisms. In particular, the epsin 1 N-terminal homology (ENTH) domain is a potent driver of membrane curvature (Ford et al., Nature 2002), and has recently been shown to play a role in membrane fission. Specifically, a recent report proposed that insertion of a wedge-like amphipathic helix by ENTH curves and destabilizes membranes, as evidenced by decreasing membrane fission ability among ENTH mutants with decreasing helix hydrophobicity (Boucrot et al., Cell 2012). However, our group recently showed that collisions among dense, membrane-bound ENTH proteins generate steric pressure, which drives membrane bending in the absence of helix insertions (Stachowiak et al., Nature Cell Biology 2012). These results prompted us to ask: is steric pressure also responsible for membrane fission by ENTH? In my preliminary studies, I found that ENTH mutants with reduced helix hydrophobicity are capable of driving fission to a similar degree as wild-type ENTH when bound to the membrane at comparable density. Interestingly, I also found that full-length epsin, which contains a bulky, intrinsically-disordered C-terminal domain, drives fission more potently than the ENTH domain alone. These results imply that, while helix insertions are important for binding proteins tightly to membrane surfaces, helices are not required for fission. However, once bound to the membrane surface at sufficient density, bulky molecules of arbitrary structure can create steric pressure that increases membrane curvature until fission occurs. Taken together, my findings reveal a novel mechanism for membrane fission. The objective of the proposed research is to quantitatively compare this new mechanism with other key mechanisms of membrane fission. The first specific aim will delineate the specific roles of wedge-like helix insertion and protein crowding in driving membrane fission. The second specific aim will examine how dynamin works cooperatively with helix insertion and protein crowding to drive robust fission. The third specific aim will utilize quantitative imaging of live cells to examine how helix insertion and protein crowding modulate fission dynamics in a physiological context. This work will create innovative biophysical tools for the simultaneous study of membrane fission and protein-lipid interactions both in vitro and in live cells. The overall outcome of this research will be a deeper understanding of the physical mechanisms of membrane fission, including the novel mechanism of membrane fission by protein crowding. The bold hypothesis described here asserts that any membrane-bound protein can contribute to fission, an idea that will influence understanding of diverse membrane compartmentalizing processes, including endocytosis, cell division, and viral entry.", ,,,

The Core will provide two main services: it will establish a repository for the long-term storage and archiving of samples and data; and it will assist Center investigators in the statistical analysis of their results. The core will assure the authenticity and quality of these specimens and it will prepare these samples for long-term storage, or dispense samples as needed. The Core will also provide scientifically valid and rigorous statistical analysis of data and support the development of innovative methods to enhance the basic and translational research efforts of Center investigators. The Core will provide state-of-the-art biostatistics and bioinformatics expertise and analytical support. Core biostatisticians will also develop new statistical methods, such as quantitative risk assessment models, for estimating cardiometabolic disease risk in exposed populations and for the analysis and evaluation of exposures and health consequences. In addition, the core will develop novel methods for the analysis of multi-pollutant exposures as they relate to health outcomes. The core will serve as a unique educational resource for training graduate students, post-doctoral fellows, residents and junior faculty and in collaboration with the Training and Administration Cores. This Core will allow Center investigators easy access to high quality, centralized data management and statistical services, and thereby will strengthen the organizational cohesion of the Center.

,9328628,"Project Summary In the proposed work, I will determine the role of the Tribbles homologue 1 (Trib1) in the development and function of granulocytes, specifically eosinophils and neutrophils. These cells are critical to prevent infection but can mediate immunopathology. Our lab and others identified Trib1 as a regulator of myeloid development. Trib1-deficient mice lack eosinophils and concomitantly expand neutrophils. This correlated with increased proteins levels of the myeloid transcription factor, C/EBP?. Despite this, it is unknown when developmentally Trib1 regulates granulopoiesis and how Trib1 controls progenitor plasticity. I observe that Trib1-deficient mice develop an atypical population of bone marrow granulocytes with both eosinophilic and neutrophilic features, suggestive of altered fate regulation. I hypothesize that Trib1 controls granulocyte identity as cells differentiate from lineage-committed progenitors. Critically, it is unknown if Trib1 can modulate mature granulocyte function in addition to development. I observe that Trib1-deficient neutrophils produce more of the pro-inflammatory cytokine TNF-? with LPS stimulation. I hypothesize that this due to a newly identified interaction between Trib1 and the NF-?B regulator MALT1, a pathway known to control inflammatory function. Despite this, it is unknown how Trib1 controls activation and if the Trib1:MALT1 interaction regulates cell function. In Aim 1, I will investigate the role of Trib1 in regulating cell fate plasticity. I will localize the developmental stage of Trib1-mediated regulation using ex vivo cultures of myeloid progenitors with inducible Trib1 deficiency. To investigate fate plasticity in vivo, I will use a fluorescent reporter to track the fate of cells that simultaneously commit to the eosinophil lineage and delete Trib1, hypothesizing that the mature neutrophil pool will contain cells derived from eosinophil progenitors. In addition, I will evaluate how C/EBP? contributes to Trib1-mediated regulation of granulopoiesis. In Aim 2, I will evaluate a novel role of Trib1 in regulating mature neutrophil activation. I will determine how Trib1-deficient neutrophils respond to inflammatory stimuli with the hypothesis that they are hyper-active. As I hypothesize that Trib1 interacts with MALT1 and suppresses NF-?B activation, I will measure NF-?B pathway activation following stimulation, using a genetic inhibitor of NF-?B to inhibit activation in Trib1-deficient cells. I will subsequently perform structure/function analysis to map the Trib1:MALT1 interaction. Finally, I will assess the function of this interaction by expressing a Trib1-mutant unable to bind MALT1 in Trib1-deficient neutrophils. This work will provide critical insights into the regulation of granulocyte development and identify novel targets for therapy in neutrophil-mediated inflammation.", ,,,

This renewal resubmission application capitalizes on the discovery of two hit series ? the imidazo[1,2-a]pyridine-3-carboxamides and the imidazo[2,1-b]thiazole-5-carboxamides ? and seeks to advance these to potential TB treatments. As the first to patent, prolifically publish, and propose the mechanism of action for the imidazo[1,2-a]pyridine-3-carboxamide (IAPC) series, we are the most experienced group to continue development of this series through primate evaluation in preparation for clinical (human) studies. Recently, we had the PK of two lead compounds evaluated in primates with one ND-10885 showing great exposure (>20 hours of drug levels above the MIC). Additionally, we have disclosed the impressive in vitro properties of the imidazo[2,1-b]thiazole 5-carboxamide (IT) series, a new promising, rationally designed, scaffold we will develop within this proposal. This new class has low nanomolar antiTB activity against H37Rv, multidrug resistant (MDR) and extreme drug resistant (XDR) Mtb as well as good in vitro metabolism and in vivo exposure with greater lung to plasma ratios. Furthermore, both these heterocyclic scaffolds (IAPC and IT) can be prepared in bulk (50 ? 100 g) inexpensively and, from these penultimate intermediates, lead compounds with animal efficacy can be prepared in just one synthetic step (amide bond formation) and in multi- gram quantities (>15 g). Through our extensive collaborations, we will evaluate all samples for antiTB activity [including MDR and XDR strains of Mtb]. We will also perform related studies, including microbe selectivity, gross toxicity particularly looking to avoid mitochondrial toxicity, metabolism, pharmacokinetics (PK), maximum tolerated dose (MTD), mice and/or monkey efficacy and mode of action studies of any new compounds with promising activity and physicochemical attributes including metabolite identification. Our criteria for a clinical candidate are: selective nanomolar potency against H37Rv and drug resistant Mtb, in vivo efficacy comparable to first line drugs isoniazid and rifampicin (at a dose <100 mg/kg), low toxicity (at least 10x over effective dose), minimal drug-drug interactions, good aqueous solubility (>100 µg/mL) and synthetic simplicity/cost effectiveness.

In Aim 1, Study a  explores stereoselection in the cellular and mitochondrial pols. Studies b and c make use of the entire  toolkit to explore chemistry vs. conformational change as a rate-limiting step In the transition-state of family  X Pol ?, family Y error-prone Pol r\, and for a series of cancer-associated Pol ß variants. In Study d, newly  synthesized bisphosphonate PPI analog leaving groups are used to reverse the polymerase reaction to  attain a free energy reaction profile for Pol ß. Study e addresses an entirely new area of polymerase  mechanistics, namely the use of EPR and ENDOR to elucidate the structure of the metal coordination site  and Its role in fidelity. Aim 2, containing three interrelated studies, spells out a detailed scaffold strategy for  the design and synthesis of selective Inhibitors of Pol ß and BER by the dual targeting of the dNTP binding  site and active site Arg183 (Study a). In Study b, we develop a new approach, using pamoic acid analogs,  to inhibit BER by selectively interfering with the Pol ß-assocated lyase. In Study c, we take an important  step along the path toward translation, by evaluating the ability of cell permeabilized scaffold compounds to  inhibit cultured cancer cells.", ,,,
,9330817,"Investigations of HPV related malignancies are heavily dependent on laboratory testing, both to measure the outcomes (cancer, pre-cancer, intraepithelial neoplasia) and to define the possible predictors (e.g. high-risk HPV types). Several new molecular diagnostic tests are becoming available, including HPV genotypes and E6/E7 molecular testing, that can be performed in lower resource settings. Thus the development of Rwanda as a regional hub for HPV/HIV translational research requires rigorous skills in histopathology and in flexible platforms for molecular testing. The Consortium proposes major studies on cervical cancer screening in HIV-positive women, and anal and penile prevalence of HPV in HIV-positive and -negative men who have sex with men (MSM). We also project pilot projects investigating other HPV related malignancies?e.g. squamous cell carcinoma of the conjunctiva (SCCC) and head and neck (SCCHN), as well as studying anal HPV in HIV+ women, and oral-genital concordance of HPV types found in HIV+ and negative MSM. With capacity building, much of the necessary laboratory testing can be done in Africa. We will develop a shared resource in laboratory support for HPV related research, both in histopathology and in molecular testing., including several promising, highly specific new biomarkers that have been reported in HIV-negative women including 1) E6/E7 HPV viral oncoprotein detection (which showed promising results in our large studies in China) and 2) Ki-67 and Topo2a mRNA. We will also establish a PCR lab for HPV genotyping, important now in assessing cervical and anal cancers, and in the future for monitoring and evaluation of vaccine impact in HIV-infected and -uninfected women. The PCR lab will support all Consortium projects: cervical, anal, and potential pilot projects of oral HPV and head and neck cancers. Drs. Tiffany Hebert and Joel Palefsky will direct the Shared Resources Core. Dr. Hebert will continue to lead the pathology capacity building. Dr. Palefsky will direct the development of the new molecular diagnostic testing capabilities.", ,,,
,9338151,"Project 4 ? SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Endometrial cancer (EC) is the most frequent gynecologic malignancy and the fourth most common cancer among women in the United States. Although cure is possible for early disease, outcomes for patients with metastatic or recurrent disease have not improved significantly over the last two decades. Based on extensive characterization by our team and The Cancer Genome Atlas, EC has a high frequency of aberrations in targetable pathways including the phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase (PI3K, 92%), ARID1A (33%), and homologous recombination (HR 22% core and 77% extended members) pathways. However, to date, targeted monotherapies have not had a major impact in EC. Thus, how to leverage the therapeutic opportunities in EC represents a major gap in knowledge that represents the overarching goal of this application. Our overall goal is: to design and implement rational combination therapy clinical trials based on high quality clinical and preclinical data and models to improve outcomes for EC patients. Aim 1 To identify and refine biomarkers of benefit in a combination trial of PARP and PI3K pathway targeted therapy in EC: Based on the underlying mutational aberrations present in EC, we are actively enrolling on the first information-rich, biopsy-embedded investigator-initiated trial targeting two nodes in the PI3K pathway (mTOR (2 dose schedules) and AKT) in combination with an effective ?trapping? PARP inhibitor, olaparib. We will test the hypothesis that combined targeting of key nodes in the PI3K pathway and PARP inhibition will demonstrate benefit in EC patients. Extensive characterization of pre- and post-treatment biopsies at the DNA, RNA and protein levels will facilitate the identification of biomarkers of benefit including our current suite of biomarkers of responsiveness to PARP and PI3K pathway inhibitors. This is a unique approach and opportunity, supported by our evidence that PI3K and HR pathways aberrations are extremely common in EC, likely rendering patients sensitive to combined PI3K and PARP pathway inhibition. Aim 2 To establish a preclinical framework to identify rational combination targeted therapies for EC to be evaluated in future EC clinical trials: Emergence of adaptive resistance to targeted therapies contributes to the lack of efficacy of monotherapy. We have used our Combinatorial Adaptive Resistance (CART) platform to identify a limited number of potential additional rational combinations for validation, aimed at adaptive resistance induced by targeting the DNA damage response. This Aim will focus on in vitro and in vivo preclinical data and biomarkers to prioritize combinations in future trials. To rapidly translate these rational drug combinations to clinical trials in this SPORE, AstraZeneca has signed a contract to provide funding for EC clinical trials with their complete therapeutic pipeline.", ,,,
,9355723,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Bronchiolitis is the #1 cause of hospitalization in US infants, with ~130,000 hospitalizations annually. Small cohort studies (n<210) suggest that 40-50% of infants hospitalized with bronchiolitis will later develop asthma. The greatest challenges for developing primary prevention strategies for this large group of children (indeed, all children) are the very early identification of modifiable risk factors and the heterogeneity of asthma. The 35th Multicenter Airway Research Collaboration (MARC-35) study (U01AI-087881; Camargo, PI) is a 17-center prospective cohort study that completed enrollment of 921 hospitalized infants with bronchiolitis in 2014. In this diverse cohort (53% African-American or Hispanic), investigators have collected biospecimens, including nasal swabs at the index hospitalization (median age 3 months) and at an age 3y exam (R01AI-114552; Camargo, PI). Follow-up data include biannual parent interviews and medical records to age 5 years, with ~90% follow-up to date. This UG3/UH3 application would: 1) extend the largest severe bronchiolitis cohort in the world (e.g., through an age 6y in-person exam to diagnose and phenotype asthma), and 2) build on our local MARC-43 cohort of 120 healthy infants by adding 600 healthy infants from four diverse sites (total n=720). Both cohorts undergo similar procedures (e.g., serial nasal swabs during early childhood). Our overarching hypothesis is that airway Moraxella abundance is associated with increased risk of childhood asthma, and our pilot data are supportive. In Aim 1, we will investigate the relation of the airway microbiome in early infancy to risk of age 6y asthma among infants with severe bronchiolitis (MARC-35). In Aim 2, we will do the same but among healthy infants (MARC-43). In Aim 3, we will investigate the relation of longitudinal patterns of the airway microbiome (e.g., infancy, age 3y, age 6y) to risk of childhood asthma in the two cohorts combined. In a subset of 200 children (100 from each cohort), we will use whole genome shotgun (WGS) sequencing to examine the relations of bacterial species and metabolic potential in early infancy to risk of asthma. For all 3 Aims, we will examine if associations differ by asthma phenotype (e.g., allergic asthma). The investigators are NIH-funded researchers working in an outstanding research environment. The proposed project is innovative and, by providing a strong evidence base for the future development of targeted microbiome interventions, advances research on the primary prevention of asthma. Moreover, the two racially/ethnically-diverse cohorts will provide the ECHO Consortium with comprehensive data on demographics, development, environmental exposures, genetics, and outcomes from two already-harmonized, multicenter U.S. studies.", ,,,
,9532455,"Bacterial pneumonia is an important clinical problem and host defense mechanisms against pneumonia are not fully understood. Data from the prior funding period using a murine model of Klebsiella pneumoniae infection has shown that bacterial deposition in the lung results in the release of the T-cell derived cytokines 1L-17A and 1L-17F, both of which can mediate neutrophil recruitment into the lung. Moreover, IL-22 is produced which can activate STATS in epithelial cells and augment epithelial barrier function as well as the induction of antimicrobial proteins. A critical source of early IL-17 is ?? T-cells but upon vaccination the cellular source of IL-17 shifts to Th17 cells. These cells not only recognize serotype 2 K. pneumoniae but also proliferate in response to other serotypes of K. pneumoniae but also to other phylogenetlcally related bacteria such as members of the enterobacteriaceae family. Thus Th17 cells can provide serotype independent immunity against clades of bacteria. In this renewal we test the hypothesis that vaccine induced Th17 cells can mediate serotype independent immunity against K. pneumoniae (and other related pathogens) by signaling through the lung epithelium. We also examine if these vaccine responses can be elicited by specific subunit antigens such as outer membrane proteins as well as secreted bacterial exososmes. Taken together the research will foster the development of new treatment for bacterial infections that have demonstrated a clear issue of drug resistance. Moreover the proposed work will continue to advance our understanding of mucosal immunity in the lung. RELEVANCE (See instructions): Bacterial pneumonia remains a significant public health concern. The extension of this proposal will study resistance mechanisms in the lung. By understanding normal resistance pathways, we hope that these pathways can be exploited for new therapies to prevent or treat bacterial pneumonia.", ,,,
,9350598,"Cancers are like uncontrolled pathogens. They multiply and spread up to the point of killing their host. Naturally our immune system protects us not only from pathogens but also from cancers. Indeed, cancer immunotherapy has been an effective therapy against many cancers. However, the underlying mechanisms in many cases are poorly understood. Type I interferon (IFN) and anti-tumor T cells are vital in controlling immunogenic tumors. IFN signaling in dendritic cells (DCs) is crucial for cross-priming of T cells against tumors. DCs mediates the immune recognition of tumors via cytosolic DNA sensing pathway and subsequent production of IFN from the DCs. It is unclear, however, how immunogenic tumors induces IFN production from DCs through the cytosolic DNA sens- ing pathway and how IFN signaling in DCs is necessary for the cross-priming of T cells. While studying host- pathogen interactions, we discovered a novel function of autophagy proteins that can provide answers to these questions. Autophagy is an evolutionarily conserved cellular pathway that encloses cytoplasmic materials in membrane-bound autophagosomes and delivers them to the lysosome for degradation. The autophagosomes form from endomembranes reorganized via the ubiquitin-like conjugation system of the autophagy pathway. We found that the conjugation system plays another essential role in the disintegration of intracellular vacuoles con- taining pathogens by tagging the vacuoles with ubiquitin-like LC3 (microtubule associated protein 1 light chain 3). The membrane bound LC3s function as molecular beacons to recruit IFN-inducible GTPases, and the re- cruited GTPases disrupt the vacuoles. As a result, the pathogens hidden inside the vacuole are exposed to the cytoplasm. We hypothesize that the same LC3 conjugation system in DCs opens up phagocytic vacuoles con- taining tumor cell DNAs and antigens by recruiting the IFN-inducible GTPases to the vacuoles. Subsequent release of the contents to the cytoplasm of the DCs will lead to cytosolic DNA sensing-dependent IFN production (positive amplification of IFN signal) and the cross-priming of cytotoxic T cells against the tumor cells. To test this hypothesis, we will investigate the role of the relevant autophagy genes and the IFN-inducible GTPases in DCs for the production and amplification of IFNs, the cross-priming of cytotoxic T cells against tumor antigens, and the control of immunogenic tumors in vivo. Successful completion of the proposed study will lead to a better understanding of innate and adaptive immune recognition of tumors. Such results are expected to have positive impact on human health because it is probable that the identified immune regulatory mechanism will provide new targets for therapeutic interventions of cancers. In addition, it is likely that the result will enhance our under- standing of how the immune system controls cytosolic vacuoles containing materials of interest (e.g. pathogens, tumors, etc.), thereby fundamentally advancing the fields of cancer biology, immunology and cell biology. Fur- ther, the targeting mechanism may be utilized for other process, like controlled drug delivery. In essence, this is a high-risk/high-reward project.", ,,,
,9330816,"The overarching goal of the Mentoring Core of the Rwanda/Einstein Consortium for research in HPV/HIV associated malignancies is to develop a cadre of junior and mid-level researchers who will utilize the resources developed by the Consortium and will become the leadership of the Consortium in the future. Rwanda is an ideal environment in which to develop the Consortium and investigators because of its investment in services for HIV and HPV disease, and its commitment to develop research as a guide to public policy decision-making. The Consortium's investment in laboratory infrastructure not only in pathology but also in cutting edge molecular diagnostic testing for HPV creates a resource for investigators to develop new research activities. Our Consortium is structured to foster continued development of the physicians trained as part of our D43-funded program Building Rwandan Research Capacity in AIDS malignancies, as well as others who have received training recently either In research or in clinical specialty training. Our primary approach is an apprenticeship model in which junior or mid-level investigators are paired with one or more experienced researchers, while executing a research project. We will provide individually tailored mentoring to nurture the careers of young Rwandan investigators and facilitate their development into independently funded researchers; catalyze research in HPV/HIV malignancies within the Consortium by providing pilot and feasibility grants, especially to young investigators recently trained via our D43 program; familiarize Consortium members and the Rwandan research community with the facilities of the Shared Resources Core in innovative molecular testing techniques for HPV; provide guidance and training to junior investigators in developing protocols for submission to the Rwandan National Ethics Committee; and facilitate/ stimulate scientific communication among active Consortium investigators by organizing monthly Consortium meetings.", ,,,
,9326880,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Consumption of alcohol (ethanol) during pregnancy can have profound and enduring consequences on the offspring, including compromised cognition and other neurodevelopmental abnormalities later in life. On the one hand, the neurodevelopmental abnormalities in the offspring as the result of exposure of the fetus to ethanol are preventable conditions. On the other hand, despite increased awareness, warnings and prevention efforts, an alarming percentage of women continue to drink during pregnancy; some even binge drink to risky levels. Ethanol readily crosses the placenta and distributes to all fetal organs, most notably the brain. In this light, we propose three specific aims to test the central hypothesis that, during active corticogenesis, in utero exposure of the fetus to ethanol, a canonical modulator of the GABAA receptor, results in interneuronopathy: Specific Aim 1: Test the hypothesis that binge exposure of the fetus to ethanol, at a gestational stage when tangential migration is most active, disrupts the migration of primordial GABAergic interneurons into the mPFC. Specific Aim 2: Test whether mPFC function is impaired in young adult mice exposed in utero to ethanol. Specific Aim 3: Examine whether adult mice exposed in utero to ethanol have (1) altered number and/or distribution of GABAergic cortical interneurons and/or (2) abnormal GABAergic neurotransmission in the mPFC.  The underlying goal of this research program is to establish a multi-level neuroanatomical, behavioral and electrophysiological analysis of whether and how ethanol consumption in pregnancy may disrupt tangential migration, lead to enduring impaired cognitive capacities, and abnormal anatomical and functional disposition of GABAergic cortical interneurons in the progeny. Our multidisciplinary approach will make important inroads into elucidating the cellular and subcellular underpinnings of interneuronopathy associated with in utero ethanol exposure. Our work will also establish the groundwork that informs future investigations on the neurodevelopmental effects of in utero ethanol exposure on cortical form and function, cognitive and behavioral outcomes and, ultimately, on their therapeutic management.", ,,,
,9470457,"ABSTRACT Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma (HNSCC) is the sixth most common cancer in the United States. Even with the recent approval of immune modulating therapies, the overall survival rate for patients that respond poorly to conventional therapy remains at 40-50%, depending on subsite. We anticipate that significant improvements to patient survival will require the development of precision medicine protocols, in which treatments are designed to target the specific disease process of the individual patient. Immune checkpoint inhibition represents one potential targeted strategy, and pembrolizumab, which inhibits the interaction of the Programmed Death-1 (PD-1) receptor with its ligands, was approved for treatment of metastatic and recurrent HNSCC in 2016. However, an objective response rate of only 18% was reported in phase II trials of pembrolizumab, and few biomarkers reliably predict responses. We believe a more detailed understanding of the mechanisms underlying expression of the immunosuppressive Programmed Death Ligand 1 (PD-L1), will aid in patient selection for anti-PD-1 therapy and provide new avenues to improve response rates and duration. Our preliminary data suggest that the fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) family may participate in PD-L1 regulation in specific subsets of HNSCC models, highlighting the potential for targetable oncogenic drivers to modulate this immunosuppressive pathway. Our central hypothesis is that genetic and immune biomarkers can predict immune checkpoint response in advanced or recurrent HNSCC, some of which (e.g. FGFR1) serve as molecular targets to alter the immunogenicity of tumor cells. Thus, this proposal has two aims that extend our initial observation of a relationship between the FGFR family and PD-L1 to define a mechanism and investigate combination FGFR and PD-1/PD-L1 inhibition as a potential therapeutic strategy. To expand this concept further, we have generated HNSCC cell lines infected with the Genome CRISPR Knock-Out (GeCKO) library from which we will first aim to select genetic knockouts conferring alterations in PD-L1 presentation on the cell surface, thereby implicating pathways involved in PD- L1 regulation. Using in vitro and in vivo models, we then aim to assess the mechanistic role of these pathways in modulating PD-L1 to identify novel therapeutic targets that may contribute to immunosuppression. By defining pathways regulating the PD-1/PD-L1 immune checkpoint, this proposal has the immediate potential to help improve upon current immunotherapy protocols for HNSCC to improve overall patient survival.", ,,,
,9210804,"Project Summary  Over 100 million Americans suffer from chronic pain, which is greater than cardiovascular disease, cancer, and diabetes combined. Current strategies for treating persistent pain address the symptomology but not the underlying pathology and often are ineffective. Defining the cellular mechanisms that mediate inflammatory signaling, a key contributor to the development of chronic pain, is likely to provide new pharmacological strategies for treating chronic pain. For the first time, utilizing pharmacological inhibition and genetic deletion of cathepsin K our laboratory has demonstrated a novel link between cathepsin K activity and inflammatory-induced peripheral nociception in the mouse. Based upon our preliminary work we hypothesize a novel role for cathepsin K, a cysteine peptidase traditionally known for its importance in osteoclast-mediated bone resorption, in mediating inflammatory-induced nociception. The objective of our proposal is to determine whether cathepsin K inhibitors can be utilized as novel analgesics. This project will utilize molecular, electrophysiological, and behavioral techniques in mice to address three aims in the pursuit of our objective: 1) Define the therapeutic parameters by which cathepsin K inhibition alleviates peripheral nociception; 2) Determine if inhibition of cathepsin K activity prevents the development and/or maintenance of neuropathic nociception; and 3) Define the dynamic changes in cathepsin K regulation after nociception. We anticipate that we will validate our preliminary findings and show that cathepsin K mediates inflammatory-induced peripheral nociception and define how cathepsin K is mediating nociception. Virtually nothing is known regarding the role cathepsin K plays in inflammation and nociception. Our laboratory?s novel observation presents with an exciting opportunity to advance the scientific community?s fundamental understanding of how inflammation mediates nociception. Consequently, our work may provide new therapeutic targets to treat the more than 100 million Americans suffering from chronic pain.", ,,,
,9548832,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Recent epidemiologic studies suggest that women with adverse pregnancy outcomes (APOs), such as preeclampsia, are at increased risk for subsequent cardiovascular diseases. However, prospective data to elucidate the precise relationship between adverse pregnancy outcomes and subsequent cardiovascular disease are lacking. To address this critical knowledge gap, the NHLBI issued a RFA to study pregnancy as a window to future maternal health. In this proposal, a multidisciplinary team with diverse talents and expertise will define the relationship between APOs and markers of cardiovascular disease risk (CVDR) at two years after delivery. This multicenter group will utilize an ethnically, raciall, socioeconomically and geographically diverse cohort of 10,000 nulliparous women enrolled in the NICHD-funded Nulliparous Pregnancy Outcomes Study: Monitoring Mothers-to-be (nuMoM2b).          The proposed studies are highly leveraged, utilizing the extensive and unique database and tissue bank developed in the parent study in which nulliparous women are evaluated over the course of pregnancy to study the mechanisms for and prediction of APOs. Women enrolled in the nuMoM2b cohort are extremely well phenotyped through prospective data collection, clinical evaluations, and ultrasound assessments, as well as through the use of standardized definitions. Demographic, psychosocial, dietary, physiologic, and outcome information is collected through maternal interviews, self-administered questionnaires, clinical measurements, ultrasounds, and medical record abstraction by trained personnel. Samples of maternal blood, urine, and cervico-vaginal fluid over pregnancy and cord blood and placenta at delivery are collected and banked. All women complete two sleep questionnaires and over 3,600 are recruited to perform objective overnight sleep studies at two times during pregnancy.          Women participating in the nuMoM2b parent study will be assessed for evidence of CVDR, including sleep disordered breathing (SDB), at two to three years postpartum. APOs in subsequent pregnancies also will be assessed. These studies will characterize the relationship between APOs and CVDR, identify first pregnancy profiles that portend subsequent CVDR, determine associations between SDB during the first pregnancy and subsequent CVDR, and identify modifiable factors that mediate the associations between CVDR and APOs in the first and subsequent pregnancy. This will allow for the development of strategies to modify these CVDR factors and to improve the health of women suffering APOs.         Relevance: NICHD is currently conducting a large study that looks for tests to identify the risk of developing pregnancy problems in women who are pregnant for the first time. In this new study, the same women will be tested again at approximately 2 years after they give birth to see if there are early signs of heart disease in those who had problem pregnancies. Information from this follow-up study will be used to improve the health of women using their experiences during pregnancy.", ,,,

The CCR10/ligand axis was suggested to play a role in directing migration and maintenance of CCR10-expressing T cells into the skin and has been implicated in many skin inflammatory diseases such as psoriasis and atopic dermatitis. However, the in vivo functional importance and mechanisms of CCR10 in regulating the cutaneous immune responses are still not clear. We have generated CCR10-knockout/EGFP-knockin mice and found that the CCR10-knockout mice have altered maintenance of skin-resident T cells and response to various skin antigen challenges. We propose to use these mouse models to study the functional mechanisms of CCR10 in regulating the skin T response and immune homeostasis.", ,,,
,9309444,"Project Summary The incidence of opioid use disorders (OUDs) has increased to near-epidemic proportions. Clinical researchers have a clear responsibility to improve access to long-term treatment in order to avoid the pattern of relapse, recurrent detoxification admissions, or overdose characteristic of present treatment efforts. While agonist maintenance with methadone or buprenorphine represents an effective long-term treatment strategy, it may be unacceptable to many individuals; this may compromise treatment seeking or prevent the initiation of maintenance treatment following detoxification. Long-acting injectable naltrexone (XR-NTX) robustly blocks the effects of opioids for at least 4 weeks and is now indicated for relapse prevention following detoxification. XR-NTX therefore represents an effective alternative to agonist treatment, but it is significantly underutilized due to hurdles associated with rapidly and tolerably transitioning active users. Indeed, about half of individuals fail to initiate XR-NTX in existing naltrexone titration protocols. Our data suggest that the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonist ketamine may be feasibly integrated into a 3-day rapid non-opioid based naltrexone titration, with sub-anesthetic infusions exerting apparent effects on spontaneous and precipitated withdrawal as well as on retention. In the proposed investigation, we aim to evaluate whether two 90-minute sub-anesthetic ketamine infusions (1.41 mg/kg), compared to 2 infusions of the control midazolam (0.04 mg/kg), improve outcomes in opioid dependent individuals engaged in a rapid non-opioid based oral naltrexone titration, followed by XR-NTX maintenance. The primary outcome will be the proportion of participants to initiate XR-NTX. Secondary outcomes include abstinence rates, 3-month retention, and withdrawal severity. The investigators' extensive experience with sub-anesthetic ketamine infusions and with antagonist-based treatment of opioid dependence supports the feasibility of this novel protocol. If successful, this trial would represent a major advance in efforts to identify novel pharmacotherapies for OUD management, and for addressing a critical hurdle in XR-NTX utilization. Thus it may pave the way for research into analogous compounds, such as ketamine- like antidepressants currently in development. This may ultimately serve to broaden access to effective maintenance treatment options for active users, and to reposition detoxification as a stepping-stone to long-term treatment. These data may therefore advance treatment efforts for OUDs and increase access to a larger repertoire of first-line treatments.", ,,,

Although there are multiple approaches to the treatment of uveitic macular edema, no comparative trials of these treatments have been performed. The goal of this proposal is to address two critical issues in the treatment of uveitic macular edema: 1) the optimal initial treatment for uveitic macular edema; and 2) the optimal treatment of persistent macular edema (i.e., macular edema that has not resolved after initial treatment). Regional corticosteroid injections are the mainstay of treatment for uveitic macular edema. However, there are different routes and formulations, which never have been compared in a trial, and the lack of definitive trials has led to considerable variability in clinical practice. or persistent macular edema, repeat injections of corticosteroids typically are administered. However, pilot studies of intravitreal methotrexate and of intravitreal ranibizumab (Lucentis) have suggested efficacy, possibly with fewer ocular side effects than corticosteroid injections, although in the case of ranibizumab possibly with more frequent injections. No comparative trials have been performed of these approaches. The existing MUST Research Group infrastructure will be leveraged to perform two comparative effectiveness clinical trials on the treatment of uveitic macular edema. The specific aims of the trials are: 1) to compare the relative effectiveness of periocular triamcinolone acetonide, intravitreal triamcinolone acetonide (Triescence), and the intravitreal dexamethasone implant (Ozurdex) for the treatment of uveitic macular edema; and 2) to compare the relative effectiveness of intravitreal ranibizumab (Lucentis), intravitreal methotrexate, and the intravitreal dexamethasone implant (Ozurdex) for the treatment of uveitic macular edema that persists after intravitreal triamcinolone injections. The results of these trials will guide clinicians regarding the best approaches for management of uveitic macular edema. The MUST Research Group is uniquely suited to address these issues based upon both its breadth of expertise and proven track record, demonstrated by the successful completion of the MUST Trial and by the ongoing MUST Follow-up Study of participants in the MUST Trial.", ,,,

In this proposal, we will employ comprehensive single cell genomics, transcriptomics, and proteomics to study in vitro and in vivo the dynamic transition of tumor and stromal cells populations, before and after standard 5-FU based chemotherapy versus ADAPT therapy directly in fresh colorectal cancer biopsies samples.

,9225700,"The recent identification of mutations in the C9orf72 and TDP-43 (TARDBP) genes causative of familial forms of frontotemporal dementia (FTD) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) has uncovered a new reality of a continuous FTD/ALS spectrum. Non-coding C9orf72-GGGGCC repeats produce toxic dipeptides by RAN translation, making mutant C9orf72 a proteinopathy, like TDP-43. Additionally, nucleo-cytoplasmic shuttling seems to underlie both pathologies, hinting at robust molecular connections. Despite these recent advances, we still have an incomplete understanding of the gene networks disrupted by mutant TDP-43 and C9orf72 and how these two distinct triggers induce overlapping pathologies. A comprehensive, genome-wide genetic screen will help uncover globally the molecular networks mediating the pathogenesis of TDP-43 and C9orf72. Our long-term goal is to identify novel and effective therapeutic targets for TDP-43- and C9orf72-based pathologies. The overall objectives of this proposal are to (1) characterize the gene networks underlying the neurotoxicity of TDP-43M337V and the PR-36 dipeptide in Drosophila, and (2) identify the best targets for therapeutic intervention. Our HYPOTHESIS is that the gene networks disrupted by TDP-43M337V and PR-36 will identify a few common pathways AND several trigger-specific mechanisms representing the wide spectrum of FTD and ALS. This hypothesis is based on preliminary results from a genetic screen of 6,600 RNAi alleles searching for modifiers of TDP-43M337V and PR-36 neurotoxicity in the Drosophila eye. So far, we have verified 55 TDP-43 suppressors, 46 PR-36 suppressors, 12 common suppressors, and 150 enhancers for each. Among the suppressors, we confirmed the role of genes involved in nuclear transport. We also found several suppressors involved in mRNA synthesis and splicing, cell signaling, proteostasis, vesicle trafficking, and others suggesting new pathogenic mechanisms. Due to the preliminary nature of these results, this R21 will support the next several steps to validate the modifiers, create the gene networks for each model, and logically rank the candidates (Aim 1). Then, we will test the protective activity of the top five suppressors in the adult brain under therapeutic conditions (Aim 2). The rationale for this proposal is that LOF mutations identifying the gene networks mediating TDP-43 and PR-36 proteotoxicity will uncover novel therapeutic targets for FTD/ALS with high therapeutic potential. The proposed experiments are SIGNIFICANT because they are expected to (1) increase our knowledge of the pathogenic mechanisms implicated in FTD/ALS and (2) identify novel therapeutic targets for FTD/ALS. The INNOVATIONS of this proposal are (1) the dual screen, (2) the genome-wide LOF screen, (3) the gene network analysis to rank the candidates, and (4) the inducible fly models to test the activity of candidate genes under therapeutic conditions. This project is appropriate for an R21 because of the preliminary, risky nature of the genetic screen and the high-reward potential of finding common therapeutic targets for TDP-43 and PR-36.", ,,,
,9372246,"The creation of large scientific studies of human behavior and social experience in the general popula- tion constitutes an enormous scientific investment ? the high value of such studies creates a high scientific pri- ority on dissemination tools that significantly expand the scientific use of such data. To date the limitation of dissemination efforts to data on the U.S. population greatly restricts the ability to test the external validity of key findings, raising the possibility that even within the U.S. population findings from any particular study population may not apply to other important populations. Dissemination of similar data resources from populations living under circumstances quite different from the U.S. and Western Europe are urgently needed so that social and behavioral scientists can quickly and easily test the breadth of external validity of key findings.  We will take advantage of NICHD's long-term investment in the Chitwan Valley Family Study (CVFS) in Nepal to achieve this high priority objective. Built from more than a dozen different awards from NICHD over 20 years, the CVFS is a very valuable data resource from outside the U.S. in social and health sciences. Harnessing this R03 program for ?archiving and documenting of existing data sets in population science?, we will implement a series of data improvements and new dissemination and data-user support tools to dramati- cally enhance the availability and usability of the CVFS data. The CVFS is an excellent comparative data re- source, featuring a 20-year panel study from Nepal with many important features. First, CVFS was specifically designed to replicate design features from the best longitudinal studies in the U.S. and Europe, such as the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID). Second, it was designed to measure dynamics of change over time in the community level, not just the individual and household levels. Third, the CVFS measures environmental changes over time, including changes in land use/land cover, habitat quality, and eco-system. Fourth, the CVFS follows all migrants (both individuals and households) no matter where they move and periodically re- freshes the sample with in-migrants. Finally, CVFS now has saliva based DNA samples from all family mem- bers and blood based anemia screening for all children. As a result the CVFS is an unparalleled resource for study change over time in contraceptive use and non-use, health across the life course, and gene by environ- ment interactions.  We will transform access to this special resource with changes focused on use of the CVFS data, measures specially designed to facilitate comparisons, construction of new data files to speed data linking and data analysis, construction of new learning tools, and new web-based analysis tools. The activities are specifically designed to improve the transparency of comparability between CVFS and data from other settings to assist scientists making these comparisons. We will also improve data quality and user experience so the complexity of these multi-level, 20-year, multi-topic data is not an obstacle to data use.", ,,,
,9321365,"Despite decades of investigation, the biochemical pathways involved in regulation of insulin secretion by glucose are incompletely understood. The overall goal of this project (DK046492-22), now entering its 23rd year of funding, is to gain a better understanding of metabolic coupling mechanisms in the ?-cell, and how they are altered when islets fail in type 2 diabetes (T2D). Since the last competitive renewal of the program in 2011, we have identified two metabolic pathways that stimulate insulin granule exocytosis, the first involving anaplerotic metabolism of pyruvate, export of mitochondrial substrates and their engagement with the cytosolic, NADP- dependent isoform of isocitrate dehydrogenase (ICDc), and activation of the glutathione/glutaredoxin (GRX) system. This pyruvate/isocitrate pathway connects to glutathione metabolism in two important ways. First, the NADPH produced in the ICDc reaction is used to maintain glutathione (GSH) and GRX in their reduced states, thereby activating GRX-mediated granule exocytosis via SENP-1. Second, the ?-ketoglutarate produced by the ICDc reaction contributes to maintenance of the GSH pool via transamination to glutamate. Using patch- clamped ?-cells from human T2D subjects, we find that NAPDH, isocitrate, and GSH all rescue insulin granule exocytosis in otherwise glucose-unresponsive beta-cells. We also identified the purine/nucleotide pathway intermediate adenosuccinate (S-AMP) as a glucose-regulated metabolite that stimulates exocytosis in normal human ?-cells and rescues secretory function in human T2D ?-cells. Thus, our work has identified two novel pathways of GSIS, and demonstrated that intermediates from both pathways rescue secretion in dysfunctional human ?-cells. Based on these findings, we propose the following new specific aims: 1. To study the pyruvate/isocitrate/GSH and S-AMP pathways via metabolic flux analysis; 2. To investigate manipulation of the NAD/NADP salvage (NAMPT) pathway as a strategy for enhancing flux through the pyruvate/isocitrate/GSH and S-AMP pathways of insulin secretion, and for reversing ?-cell dysfunction in T2D; 3. To test potential additive effects of co-activation of the S-AMP, pyruvate/isocitrate/GSH and NAMPT pathways, and to define targets within these pathways for rescue of ?-cell dysfunction in T2D.", ,,,

,9285488,"Abstract  Accurate segregation of chromosomes to daughter cells during cell division is critical for cell viability and normal development. Errors in chromosome segregation are correlated with cancer progression and cause some types of severe birth defects (e.g. Down Syndrome). Chromosome segregation is controlled by the mitotic/meiotic spindle, which is a large macromolecular structure composed primarily of microtubules and associated proteins. Chromosome movements are powered by attachment of microtubules to the kinetochore and errors in kinetochore-microtubule attachment lead to aneuploidy. Decades of work have identified many proteins that are important for the assembly and function of the mitotic spindle, yet much remains unknown about regulation of spindle assembly. Recent work from our lab and others has shown that in addition to proteins hundreds of different mRNAs and components of the translation apparatus as well as long noncoding RNAs are also localized to the mitotic spindle and chromosomes and play a role in kinetochore and spindle assembly. Our group and others have also recently demonstrated that centromeres are transcribed into a long, noncoding RNA important for kinetochore assembly and function. We showed that lncRNAs bind to and activate the mitotic kinase Aurora-B. In this proposal we describe a series of experiments designed to elucidate the roles and mechanisms of RNAs localized to the spindle and chromosomes during mitosis. We propose a series of experiments to examine how kinetochore proteins promote transcription of centromeric repeats during mitosis and how this is related to changes in kinetochore-microtubule attachment. We then propose a series of detailed biochemical experiments to understand how various centromere proteins interact with RNA and how this interaction influences their centromere functions. In addition to being regulated by RNA binding recent work demonstrates that Aurora-B controls the binding of noncoding RNAs to the chromosomes during mitosis. In the final Aim we propose to study the mechanism by which Aurora-B promotes the release of lncRNAs from mitotic chromosomes. We focus on the interaction between Aurora-B and hnrnp U and the consequences of a failure to remove lncRNAs from chromosomes during mitosis. Taken together, these Aims will provide insight into the interaction of Aurora-B with spindle, chromatin, and kinetochore-localized RNAs and how these interactions lead to successful chromosome segregation. These studies are likely to provide fundamental insight into the mechanisms of spindle assembly and cell division and could provide additional insight into mechanisms of cancer progression and the cause of birth defects.", ,,,
,9341235,"DESCRIPTION (provided by the applicant):   Insulin stimulates the mobilization of glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4) storage vesicles from intracellular pools to the plasma membrane, resulting in an influx of glucose into target tissues such as muscle and fat. This system is disturbed in insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes. Insulin-stimulated insertion of GLUT4 into the plasma membrane is the end product of a series of protein-protein interactions and dynamic cytoskeletal events that are still under investigation. In the first submission, we showed that CLIP-associating protein 2 (CLASP2), a protein previously unassociated with insulin action, is responsive to insulin. Using a mass spectrometry-based proteomics approach combined with phosphoserine antibody immunoprecipitation from L6 myotubes, we detected a 4.8-fold increase of CLASP2 in the insulin stimulated anti-phosphoserine immunoprecipitates as compared to basal. Western blotting of CLASP2 immunoprecipitates with the phospho- antibody confirmed that CLASP2 undergoes insulin-stimulated phosphorylation. Confocal imaging of L6 myotubes revealed that CLASP2 is positioned at the plasma membrane within areas of insulin-mediated cortical actin remodeling. Since insulin-induced cortical actin reorganization is a target for GLUT4 translocation, we tested for detection of both CLASP2 and GLUT4 within the plasma membrane ruffle generated by insulin- stimulated dynamic actin remodeling. Confocal imaging revealed that CLASP2 colocalizes with GLUT4 at insulin-stimulated plasma membrane ridges. CLASP2 is known to direct the distal end of microtubules to the cell cortex, and it has been shown that GLUT4 travels along microtubule tracks. In support of the prospect that CLASP2 directs microtubule-based delivery of GLUT4 to cell cortex landing zones important for insulin action, siRNA mediated knockdown of CLASP2 in L6 myotubes inhibited insulin-stimulated GLUT4 translocation to the plasma membrane. Furthermore, siRNA mediated knockdown of CLASP2 in 3T3-L1 adipocytes inhibits insulin- stimulated glucose transport. The revised proposal presents new preliminary data from the previously proposed endogenous CLASP2 interactome studies from 3T3-L1 adipocytes, in which several known CLASP2 interacting proteins were identified, validating the approach. Mouse tissue was analyzed and an isoform- specific CLASP2 protein expression pattern in insulin-sensitive tissues such as muscle and fat was discovered. New preliminary data has identified insulin-regulated endogenous CLASP2 phosphorylation within L6 myotubes, including phosphorylation that is sensitive to inhibition of either glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3) or PI 3-kinase (PI 3-K). Within systems such as cell migration, CLASP2 is known to be negatively regulated by GSK3. We therefore propose to test the overall hypothesis that CLASP2 is negatively regulated by GSK3- mediated phosphorylation in the basal state. Inactivation of GSK3 by insulin through PI 3-K relieves CLASP2, allowing for the distal end of microtubules to situate at the specific CLASP2-targeted landing zones on the cell cortex, whereby situating GLUT4 containing vesicles proximal to the plasma membrane.", ,,,
,9298156,"Project Summary: Racial/ethnic disparities in mental health care for youth remain large and persistent despite national attention to disparity reduction. Youth from minority racial/ethnic groups are approximately one-third to one-half as likely to receive mental health care as white youth. Disparities exist not only in initial access to care, but also in service completion and quality. These disparities in care access and quality likely contribute to the greater persistence, severity, and disease burden of mental disorder among African Americans and Latinos in adulthood. Due to the severe shortage of child and adolescent psychiatrists, primary care settings have become the first point of contact and the treatment site for all children and adolescents with behavioral issues. The patient centered medical home (PCMH) has been demonstrated as a promising model to empower primary care providers to perform screening, treatment and monitoring for pediatric mental disorders. However, its implication for addressing disparities has not yet been directly assessed. The Goal of the proposed research is to examine whether access to PCMH with integrated behavioral services, achieved through either service colocation or telepsychiatry, could remedy disparities in the care for pediatric major depressive disorders (MDD). In collaboration with one of the largest Medicaid managed care plan in southeast Texas, with more than 400,000 pediatric enrollees, we will combine the most recent Medicaid claims data (2013-16) with provider characteristics and systematic factors such as practice setting, practice size, and geographic location. Service colocation will be ascertained based on Geocoding, and the use of telepsychiatry will be identified using the Current Procedural Terminology codes. Our aims are: I. To examine the impact of having a PCMH as the ?usual care provider? on the identification of MDD and to assess its association with the racial/ethnic disparity in MDD diagnosis rate; II. To compare the likelihood of receiving MDD treatment between those MDD cases first diagnosed at a PCMH versus traditional primary care, and to assess its association with the racial/ethnic disparity in MDD treated rate; III. To compare the impact of initiating MDD treatment within a PCMH versus a traditional primary care setting on the treatment quality and outcomes and to assess its contribution to racial/ethnic disparity reduction. Guided by the Andersen/Aday health care access model, we will test the Hypothesis that accessing primary care with high structural quality (behavioral service integration present) can disproportionally benefit the minority groups and reduce racial/ethnic disparity in process quality (MDD identification, treated rates, and treatment quality), eventually leading to reduced racial/ethnic disparity in outcome quality (fewer emergency room visits and psychiatric hospital admissions). This innovative study is the first that concurrently examines the quality impact of service colocation and telepsychiatry and its relevance to racial/ethnic disparities in pediatric mental disorders. Findings will inform policy makers the effectiveness of the PCMH initiatives currently being implemented.", ,,,
,9402024,"Abstract/Project summary:  It is estimated that cardiovascular disease (CVD) accounts for nearly 1 of every 3 deaths in the United States (30.8%, American Heart Association, 2013). Atherosclerosis is the leading cause of CVD, and inflammation and dysregulation of the innate immune response are critical processes in all phases of disease progression. Macrophages are the predominant innate immune cell type in atheromatous plaques and play a major role in disease progression. Macrophage chitotriosidase-1 (CHIT1) is a mammalian chitinase that is produced, stored, and secreted by activated macrophages as part of the innate immune response against exogenous, chitin-containing pathogens. Previously published work from our laboratory revealed that Inhibition of chitinase promotes atherosclerosis in hyperlipidemic mice. Our preliminary data suggest that over-expression of CHIT1 results in modulation of macrophage function upon stimulation with both pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory mediators. Alterations in lipid handling properties of macrophages was also observed upon incubation with oxidized-LDL and acetylated-LDL. Despite the absence of an endogenous mammalian substrate, CHIT1 appears to have cytokine-like signaling functions independent of its enzymatic activity. These findings led us to the following central hypothesis: Macrophage over-expression of CHIT1 will attenuate the development of atherosclerosis by limiting inflammation and lipid accumulation. The aims that I propose to test this hypothesis are: Aim 1) Investigate the effect of CHIT1 over-expression on inflammatory response in macrophages, Aim 2) Determine whether CHIT1 over-expression modulates lipid accumulation in macrophages, and Aim 3) Explore the effects of CHIT1 over-expression in atherosclerosis mouse model. We have developed an LDLR-/-/ CHIT1 over-expressing mouse model (CHIT1-Tg) which will allow us to study the effects of CHIT1 over- expression on atherosclerosis in vivo. Bone marrow-derived macrophages from LDLR-/- /CHIT1-Tg and CRE-, littermate controls will be used to determine whether CHIT1 augments inflammation and lipid uptake by macrophages in vitro. Achieving these aims will allow us to elucidate the relationship between CHIT1 and atherosclerosis as it pertains to sterile inflammation, leukocyte migration, and lipid handling by macrophages; all critical aspects of therapeutic intervention and potential modes of disease cessation.", ,,,
,9531487,"The budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae is used as model system to understand genomic mechanisms by which chromatin organization is established. The start sites of genes, or promoters, are typically encased in a nucleosome-free region, that is bookended with two well-positioned nucleosomes. This precise organization is standard for most genes, and plays into how these genes are regulated. Therefore a fundamental understanding of gene regulatory mechanisms requires a complete understanding of how such canonical nucleosome organization arises and guides the placement of the transcription machinery. The proposed work will take advantage of biochemical reconstitution of aspects of canonical nucleosome organization on a genomic scale. This will allow individual mechanistic contributions of chromatin organizing factors and their effectors to be explicitly defined. In particular, how ATP-dependent chromatin remodeler complexes recognize DNA features and sequence-specific organizing factors, will be addressed. The organization of chromatin directs the organized assembly of the transcription machinery. Biochemical reconstitution will be used to tease apart selected individual contributions of chromatin organization and activator/repressor binding towards assembly of the transcription machinery on a genomic scale. Chromatin is generally thought to be composed of nucleosome particles containing 2 copies of each of the four core histones. However, it is now becoming clear that various partially assembled nucleosomes or subnucleosomes exist in vivo, and these structures may play critical roles in chromatin dynamics. The existence of these substructures and the histone chaperones that are likely to be involved in their assembly and disassembly will be investigated on a genomic scale.", ,,,

,9353336,"PROJECT SUMMARY LIM domain only-2 (LMO2) is one of the most frequently deregulated oncogenes in sporadic and gene therapy- induced human acute T-cell lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL). Lmo2 encodes an 18 kDa protein that binds class II basic helix-loop-helix transcription factors (i.e. bHLH: TAL1 or LYL1) and GATA factors (GATA1-2) and LIM domain binding protein 1 (LDB1) in a large multi-subunit complex at promoters and enhancers of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs). LDB1 binds to LMO2 via its LIM interaction domain (LID) and its homodimerization links near and distant E box-GATA sites in erythroid progenitors. The nature of the LMO2-associated protein complex in T-ALL and LMO2's transcriptional targets in T-ALL are not well characterized. We addressed these questions through a mouse genetic approach. We generated CD2-Lmo2 transgenic mice and defined two distinct subtypes of highly penetrant T-ALLs: one class of leukemias had familiar Notch1 mutation and Notch1-target gene upregulation and the second class closely modeled Early T- cell Precursor (ETP-) ALL, a highly treatment-resistant subtype. ETP-ALLs are derived from developing T-cell progenitors, express antigens of other lineages, have a transcriptional profile that resembles hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), and express LMO2, HHEX, MYCN, MEF2C, and LYL1 oncogenes. All these features are recapitulated in CD2-Lmo2 transgenic mice including the ETP-ALL transcriptional signature, which is upregulated along with Lmo2-induced hematopoietic stem cell- (HSC) like features of differentiation arrest, relative quiescence, and enhanced self-renewal. In preliminary data, LDB1 was concordantly expressed and co-purified with LMO2 protein in ETP-ALL cells. Using conditional deletion in thymocytes, where Ldb1 is dispensable for T-cell development, we discovered that Ldb1 was required for Lmo2-induced T-ALL; through mutagenesis studies, we found specific residues within the LID of LDB1 that are required for LMO2 binding; most strikingly, LDB1 mutant proteins that could not bind LMO2 were unstable. In fact, LDB1 and LMO2 proteins stabilize each other. Additionally, to address the concordant upregulation of LMO2 with specific oncogenes in ETP-ALL, we performed LDB1 ChIP-seq analysis and discovered occupancy of LMO2 and LDB1 at many genes in the ETP-ALL HSC-like signature including LYL1 and HHEX. We also discovered that Hhex is a required transcriptional target for Lmo2-induced T-ALL. In summary, our preliminary data on Lmo2 and T- ALL establishes an essential protein partner, Ldb1, and an essential target, Hhex, in a highly treatment- resistant leukemia, ETP-ALL. In this proposal, we will test the hypothesis that Ldb1 deletion attenuates T-ALL development by reducing the pre-leukemic target population in CD2-Lmo2 transgenic mice. We will also investigate whether Ldb1 deletion causes destabilization of Lmo2 protein by ubiquitin-mediated proteasomal degradation and disrupts transcriptional regulation of key targets such as Hhex.", ,,,
,9325544,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): MicroRNAs represent a large class of non-coding RNAs that regulate gene expression by interacting with the 3'-untranslated region of target mRNAs. In addition to being essential regulators of development, differentiation and many other basic cellular processes, microRNA expression is associated with the progression of cancer and other chronic diseases, suggesting that regulation of specific microRNAs could have significant therapeutic benefits.  Our objective is to investigate the mechanism by which pre-mRNA splicing factors regulate processing of a subset of miRNA precursors. Since we have also identified peptide mimetics that inhibit processing of an oncogenic miRNA (miR- 21) by the RNase III enzyme Dicer, we also propose to investigate the mechanism of inhibition of microRNA processing by this new class of molecules and to further develop their activity. We specifically propose to:  1) Study the regulation of microRNA processing by the Fox-1 family of splicing factors. We will investigate the structural and biochemical mechanism of regulation and the physiological consequences of  downregulation of miR-20b expression by Fox-1 and Fox-2.  2) Study the structural and biochemical mechanism of inhibition of microRNA processing by a new class of peptide mimetics and by engineered RNA- binding proteins we have identified.  3) Improve the activity of the peptide inhibitors we have discovered. By conducting this project, we will investigate how processing of microRNA precursors is regulated by endogenous RNA-binding proteins and by exogenous inhibitors. This will provide information critical to understand post-transcriptional regulation of microRNA production, and new approach to inhibiting the activity of oncogenic microRNAs and to improve the potency of the inhibitors.", ,,,
,9394473,"Abstract Recent reports showing accumulation of gadolinium (Gd) in the brain following administration of MRI contrast agents have prompted a necessary search for potential causes and associated risks. Currently, there is no literature to explain why the Gd-based contrast agents (GBCAs) deposit in the brain, and whether or not they are causing harm. These contrast agents are used frequently in daily practice, and each dose contributes to the accumulated amount of Gd in the brain. Since there is no correlation between Gd deposited in the brain and days since dose, these deposits do not seem to diminish over time. This issue has provoked responses from patients who are experiencing painful and disorienting symptoms and clinically significant Gd concentrations in their urine and tissues for months to years after receiving a GBCA; this syndrome has been recently described as Gd Deposition Disease (GDD). A concerning report from these patients is a ?brain fog,? which begins early in the disease process. These symptoms are consistent with the known actions of free Gd ions, which inhibit ion-gated channels, and have the potential to induce apoptosis. Unfortunately, there are currently no studies investigating whether the deposition of Gd seen in the brain is intact GBCA or free Gd ions. However, it has long been known that release of Gd from GBCAs in the body is more rapid than measured release in vitro. It is also known that free Gd can bind to the iron-transporting protein transferrin; transferrin is transported into the brain and releases its cargo in areas where Gd accumulates (e.g. globus pallidus and dentate nucleus). This proposal outlines a series of studies which will test the hypothesis that Gd is deposited in the brain by dissociation from GBCA and transport by transferrin. This basic approach to a clinical problem in neuroradiology will be useful for understanding a recently described disease state associated with current imaging practices. The specific aims of this study will be addressed primarily with in vivo models: Aim 1: Determine the speciation of Gd and GBCAs in vivo, and how species in the blood and urine correlate to Gd species in the brain; this aim will be addressed by in vitro binding studies using human and rat plasma, and an in vivo rat study using mild extraction to separate and measure Gd in free or chelated form in tissues; Aim 2: Determine the role of transferrin on Gd deposition in the brain; this will be addressed by using rat models with variable transferrin saturation or nephrogenic systemic fibrosis followed by measurement of brain deposition distribution associated with these variables; Aim 3: Determine how extravasation of GBCAs correlate to whole-body and brain Gd burden; these studies will involve measurement of Gd concentration in the plasma after dosing rats partially intravenously and partially subcutaneously, to determine if there is a correlation between brain deposition and extravasation. Together, these aims will contribute towards improved understanding and management of GDD, specifically brain Gd deposition, and provide clinicians and patients with more insight for appropriate use of GBCAs.", ,,,

The program is co-ordinated by the Administrative Core with oversight from the Executive Committee and Advisory Board. The program has well?defined processes for candidate recruitment, and will continue to devote significant effort to recruit women and minorities an initiative that has been successful in the past funding periods when 50% of trainees were female and 31% minorities (Hispanic or African American). Both MD and PhD trainees will be able to take advantage of courses available through the Clinical Scientist Training Program at BCM and will have a strong group of mentors with broad translational expertise. We have also developed mentoring strategies that enhance the training program. These include providing trainees with multiple mentors that possess complementary skills, and with individualized training plans. Additionally, trainees have access to the SPORE cores (clinical research and biostatistics, cell processing and vector production, biospecimen and pathology) with unique expertise in cell and gene therapy and clinical research. In the last 9 years, 14 awardees have completed this program and seven are now incorporated into SPORE projects. This program will therefore insure that the SPORE will train investigators who will contribute to translational lymphoma research.", ,,,
,9322312,"Project Summary: This project seeks to develop new treatments for glaucoma based on protection of retinal ganglion cells (RGC) from intraocular pressure (IOP) related stress at the optic nerve head (ONH). The PI recently published that oral losartan?s inhibition of transforming growth factor ? decreases RGC death in experimental glaucoma. The present work uses related sartans, but delivers them by periocular injection in sustained delivery form. Further drugs will be screened by a new test using inhibition of pERK and thrombospondin in immunoblot after short-term IOP elevation in mice. Human neuroprotection trials will have all persons undergoing IOP-lowering and some assigned to neuroprotection. We will do this in glaucoma animals, to improve the translation of animal to human research. IOP lowering in rodents will be done by innovative sustained delivery of dorzolamide and latanoprost, developed in our lab by collaborators in this proposal, Ian Pitha and Justin Hanes, eliminating daily eyedrop treatment for patients and mice.  To identify the pathways of early RGC glaucoma damage and to test beneficial effects of sartans, we developed two new ex vivo ocular models. First, mouse eye ONH and sclera are studied in transgenic mice with fluorescent astrocytes under controlled IOP conditions, viewed from posteriorly with optic nerve removed to study the ONH-sclera mechanical behavior by second harmonic generation and 2P confocal imaging. IOP is raised and its effects on ONH- sclera unit modeled using 3D DVC and finite element analysis in collaboration with mechanical engineer, Vicky Nguyen. The effects of age, mouse strain, past glaucoma exposure, connective tissue modification, and drug treatment will each be evaluated. This will improve understanding of glaucoma pathogenesis and identify better drug candidates for RGC protection.  The second explant allows study of longitudinal view of the optic nerve head and nerve viewed after enucleation by confocal 2P microscopy in transgenic mice, 2 strains with selective RGC axon fluorescence, one with fluorescent amyloid precursor protein (APP), 2 have fluorescent mitochondria, and 2 fluorescent astrocytes. In mitochondria, we measure quantitative changes in their density, speed of axonal transport and free radical content. Axon damage is quantified by assessment of APP transport and axon integrity index. Glaucoma?s initial injury occurs in this ONH zone, allowing development of uniquely new information in real time video on axon damage.

,9311712,"Project Summary: The machine used for template-guided protein synthesis?the ribosome and its associated translation factors?has been exploited for over 20 years to site-specifically incorporate > 150 unnatural ?-amino acids and > 10 ?-hydroxy acids into proteins, in vitro, in cells, and in animals. More exotic monomers, including N-alkyl ?-amino acids, D-amino acids, and some ?-amino acids have been incorporated using cell-free in vitro systems. These efforts have deepened our understanding of protein and RNA function and provided real-world commodities such as antibody-drug conjugates, modified therapeutics, and biomaterials to benefit society. Yet, even after two-plus decades of research, until very recently?the preliminary results for this application?there were no reports of a ribosome able to introduce a ?-amino acid into a protein in vivo, nor any sophisticated bioinformatics tools for ribosome redesign. The goal of this application is to develop and apply genetic engineering, bioinformatics, and chemical biology tools to repurpose the bacterial translational apparatus for the templated, in vivo biosynthesis of proteins and polypeptides containing backbone-modified monomers. The primary focus is on ?- amino acids, as preliminary results indicate that this goal is attainable with a 4-5 year RO1 award, but the strategies, insights, and tools developed will provide a robust infrastructure for the sequence-templated biosynthesis of diverse classes of evolvable matter?truly exotic biopolymers?whose functions are limited only by our collective imagination. By creating new machines that efficiently incorporate ?-amino acids into proteins in vivo, we will not only provide tools to address enduring questions about natural translation, but also provide real benefit to diverse segments of bio-medical research engine.", ,,,
,9282388,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This is a renewal of the existing Emory University Vaccinology Training Program T32 that was first funded in 2009. Emory is uniquely positioned to train a cadre of scientists with expertise in multi-disciplinary approaches to vaccines. The faculty preceptors have the breadth of expertise and mentoring experience that are critical for training a new generation of Vaccinologists.

,9353431,"?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Our long-term goal is to understand the mechanism and function of the ubiquitin- proteasome system in health and disease. This proposal focuses on the function of the XPC-Rad23 complex in DNA damage response and proteolysis. Mutations in XPC protein lead to a genetic disorder Xeroderma pigmentosum (XP) that exhibits extreme sunlight sensitivity and a strong propensity for skin cancer. XPC was known previously as a key DNA repair factor that cells employ to protect from sunlight-inflicted DNA injury. Specifically, XPC forms a complex with Rad23 and together scan the genome for DNA lesions, which can trigger nucleotide excision repair. However, not all of the phenotypes in XPC patients can be easily explained by DNA repair defects, suggesting that XPC may have other cellular roles. Others and we have previously found that its cofactor Rad23 participates in ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis. Rad23 specifically promotes the transfer of ubiquitylated substrates to the proteasome, which remains one of the most challenging issues in the ubiquitin field. Why do cells employ the same XPC-Rad23 complex in two distinct processes: DNA repair and proteolysis? We hypothesize that XPC and Rad23 functionally coordinate proteolysis and DNA damage response, and XPC mechanistically assists Rad23 in substrate selection. We have carved out unique niches and established solid footings to unravel the detailed mechanisms underlying the biological function of Rad23 and XPC in yeast and mammalian cells. We will tackle the elusive mechanism governing the dual role of XPC and Rad23 in proteolysis and DNA damage response via various state-of-art approaches including molecular biology, biochemistry, biophysics, genomics and proteomics. We propose the following aims in an effort to decipher the biological role of the XPC-Rad23 complex in substrate proteolysis. Aim 1 is to define the physiological role of Rad23 and XPC in mammalian cells. Aim 2 is to determine the biological function of Rad23 and Rad4 (yeast counterpart of XPC) in yeast. These studies should reveal novel insights into the mechanisms and functions of the ubiquitin system in DNA damage response. As ubiquitin plays pivotal regulatory functions in nearly every area of cell biology, the results will strongly impact other biological studies and provide defined molecular targets for future intervention in human diseases.", ,,,
,9341206,"PROJECT SUMMARY The nail salon industry is one of the fastest growing industries, generating approximately 8.5 billion U.S. dollars in 2014. The industry comprises nearly 380,000 nail technicians ? more than 51% of whom are Vietnamese refugees and immigrants of child-bearing age. These workers are exposed daily to an array of volatile organic chemicals (VOCs) and other chemicals from nail polish, polish removers, and artificial nail applicators that potentially could cause harmful acute and chronic health effects such as irritations to the skin and respiratory system and cognitive symptoms. The goal of this proposed research is to provide an effective, theory-based health training module that can be used by Vietnamese nail salon owners and workers who have limited/no access to in-person training. In the first aim, we will identify the knowledge gaps regarding the workplace hazards and perceived barriers to safe practices. Because the goal of this aim is to identify knowledge gaps, beliefs, and perceived barriers, qualitative methods (focus groups and interviews) will be used to collect in-depth behavior information. The second aim focuses on developing the training module using a theory-based intervention-development framework. Technical information that will be included in the training module are: 1) chemicals of greatest concerns and their health effects and 2) hierarchy of controls, such as installation of local exhaust ventilation, use of personal protective equipment, and administrative controls. While addressing the barriers to adopting the recommended best practices, the module also will incorporate visual demonstrations, facts, interviews, and narratives of success stories from nail salon owners who operate healthy salons. In the third aim, we will conduct a pilot randomized intervention study to assess the feasibility of conducting a larger randomized study to evaluate the efficacy of our training module. This aim serves to provide us feasibility outcomes (e.g., participation rate, retention rate), and develop outcome measures. Upon completion of the project, we will have tested the training module, survey questionnaire, and protocol for a larger randomized intervention study. The portability of the module and increasing use of the Internet and social media for information will allow our training module to be made available online in order to reach a larger percentage of Vietnamese nail technicians and reduce the disparities in access of health information in this population. This project is part of a larger mentored career- development plan in which the investigator will use the award period to take didactic classes to obtain additional training in 1) health promotion, intervention development, and evaluation and 2) occupational epidemiological methods. While the nail salon project will provide practical training in health promotion and intervention development, the investigator will also collaborate on projects with experts in the field to gain practical training in occupational epidemiology.", ,,,
,9274686,"RESEARCH STRATEGY Project Abstract for Both Competition A and B The South Carolina Department of Agriculture (SCDA) is soliciting a Cooperative Agreement to provide financial support for additional personnel, travel costs and equipment needs to support the animal feed regulatory program as it moves into conformance with the Animal Feed Regulatory Program Standards (AFRPS) as presented by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). SCDA also seeks funding to become a key building integrated into the nation?s food and feed safety system through obtaining ISO/IEC 17025:2005 accreditation for its animal feed laboratory. A significant portion f the funding stream (from Competition B) will be dedicated to purchasing equipment adding full time employees, and providing employee training that is required to obtain the international standards of which this accreditation symbolizes. In September 2014, SCDA began taking steps towards implementing the AFRPS. These measures include amending the SC Commercial Feed Act to reflect the AAFCO Model Feed Bill, developing drafts of several Standard Operating Procedures pertaining to feed safety, and maintaining a full time Animal Feed Control Official position on staff within the Consumer Protection Division (CPD). The Animal Feed Control Official serves as a volunteer with the FDA workgroup in reviewing and making suggestive edits to the AFRPS Standards. SCDA leadership is now soliciting federal funds to assist in building the capacity of the SC animal feed regulatory program and the laboratory capabilities as the Appropriated Funds set forth by the South Carolina General Assembly for the annual budget of these services present a significant barrier. This financial barrier will continue to impose upon the SCDA?s ability to expand, improve, and evolve the regulatory activities in SC, and thus gives reason for this solicitation. With available funding to implement the AFRPS and obtain ISO/IEC 17025:2005 laboratory accreditation, additional full time regulatory and laboratory employees will be hired to coordinate and implement the programs. Funds will make significant equipment upgrades and additions to the laboratory?s current inventory possible, and infrastructure improvements like computer hardware will take place in both areas.", ,,,
,9338148,"Abstract Endometrioid-type endometrial carcinoma (EEC) accounts for approximately 75% of all endometrial carcinomas, the fourth most common cancer in women in the US. Many patients with early stage and low grade EEC will be cured by surgery alone but for women who present with higher grade, advanced stage EEC, more aggressive therapeutics are needed to control the disease. From TCGA data (and validated from our own patients) we have identified four transcriptome subtypes of EEC with distinct clinicopathologic characteristics and mutation spectra. Cluster II consists of younger, obese patients with low grade EEC yet diminished survival. Although the Cluster II tumors had the lowest overall mutation rate, CTNNB1 exon 3 mutations were very common. These mutations were associated with activation of the Wnt/?-catenin signaling pathway. We hypothesize that mutations in exon 3 of CTNNB1 reprogram the molecular landscape leading to clinically aggressive EEC. Understanding of these mutations will better inform specific strategies targeting the Wnt pathway including cyclin D and CDK4. The following specific aims are proposed to test this hypothesis. Specific Aim 1. Test the hypothesis that exon 3 mutations of CTNNB1 alter cellular epigenetic programs, thus suppressing the hormonal gene expression program and activating a mesenchymal/neuronal and immunosuppressive gene expression programs. 1.1. Functionally characterize the 7 hot spot mutants by establishing isogenic stable lines expressing each of the mutants. 1.2. Characterize the regulatory network of mutant CTNNB1 by transcriptome and miRNA profiling of the stable lines and identify the target genes, initially focusing on ESR1, PGR, N-cadherin, PDGFA, WNT5A, WNT5B, IL-10, and TGFB2. 1.3. Determine the possible driver effect of N-cadherin, WNT5A, and WNT5B by gain of function or loss of function via siRNA (individually or in combinations) and examining relevant in vitro cellular endpoints. Specific Aim 2. Establish preclinical and clinical models to test the hypothesis that activating mutations of CTNNB1 are important drivers of tumorigenesis. 2.1. Evaluate the effects of CTNNB1 mutation in vivo. 2.2. Utilize a 3D in vitro system to test alternative therapeutics targeting Wnt/?-catenin signaling. 2.3. Determine if CTNNB1 mutation promotes the formation of an immunosuppressive microenvironment in hysterectomy specimens. Specific Aim 3. Conduct a phase II, single arm therapeutic trial of ribociclib (Novartis CDK4/6 inhibitor), letrozole, and everolimus for advanced/recurrent EEC. We have previously shown that letrozole+everolimus is effective in a subset of these patients. Cyclin D1 is one of the highest induced proteins in CTNNB1-mutated endometrial carcinomas, and it interacts with CDK4/6 to promote cell cycle progression. We hypothesize that patients with carcinomas with CTNNB1 mutation will have higher expression of Cyclin D1 and therefore be more responsive to treatment with this combination. The trial will be enriched for patients with tumors with CTNNB1 mutations.", ,,,
,9345317,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant) ABSTRACT (OVERALL): Low-income rural communities experience significant cancer health disparities, including lower screening rates, increased incidence, and later stage at detection, poorer survival, and higher mortality. The Southern Illinois University School of Medicine (SIUSM) and its Simmons Cancer Institute serve much of the central rural, southern rural, and Delta regions of Illinois. These rural communities have higher poverty rates and are medically underserved with disparately high cancer burden. SIUSM has established a partnership with the NCI-designated Siteman Cancer Center (SCC) at Washington University in Saint Louis (WUSTL), and SCC's Prevention and Control Program, entitled, Addressing Rural Cancer Health Disparities: An SCC-SIUSM PARTNERSHIP. To prepare for this application, we initiated planning activities in summer 2013. These collaborative planning activities included shared discussions, bi-monthly executive conference calls, in-person meetings at both sites, and early collaborative research efforts between SCC and SIUSM investigators. An Internal Advisory Committee comprised of representatives from each institution and key stakeholders from the region was formed and active in planning this application. The partnership goals are to: 1) build SIUSM cancer research capacity and support SIUSM faculty in transitioning to NIH-funded cancer disparities research, 2) provide opportunities for mid- and senior-level investigators to engage in cross- institutional cancer research and increase the rural cancer research scope and capacity at SCC, and 3) foster the development of post- doctoral scholars and junior faculty at both institutions to develop independent researchers in cancer disparities research. We will use three strategies to achieve these goals: First, a newly developed Pilot Research Program now allows junior investigators to gain research seed funding, collaborative experience and preliminary data for future NIH grants. This growing program prompted by this NCI PAR has already funded one on-going collaborative pilot, and another pilot is included in this application. Second, SCC will provide SIUSM faculty and trainees with access to research seminars and other training opportunities at SCC, and offer short-term investigator exchange programs. Third, building on career development activities ongoing at SCC, the two institutions will share strategies for faculty early career development. In particular, WUSTL's Division of Public Health Sciences offers a 10-month Master's degree in Population Health Science. We will identify clinician-scientists at SIUSM who want to build these research skills through coursework. We envision that these training activities may grow into an R25E or T32 application for rural cancer disparities research. Building on and leveraging the world-class cancer research and training programs at SCC and its Division of Public Health Science, and the rurally-focused mission of SIUSM and its commitment to develop population health science research, this Partnership will provide an important avenue for training and supporting a cadre of basic, clinical and population-based scientists at SIUSM with a focus on alleviating rural cancer disparities.", ,,,
,9352689,"Project Summary/Abstract:  Parkinson's disease is a chronic, complex neurologic condition that causes progressive declines in activity level, walking, and balance. These mobility impairments are associated with worse quality of life and mortality. Physical therapy (PT) has been shown to effectively treat these mobility problems, and exercise is associated with better quality of life and increased physical activity. Evidence-based PT guidelines for people with Parkinson's disease have been developed to support mobility and exercise participation across all disease severities, but our preliminary data indicates that PT is used inconsistently in the United States (US). The two research objectives of this F32 postdoctoral fellowship are (1) to describe current PT practice in the US and evaluate the extent to which it reflects the existing evidence-based guidelines, and then (2) to determine barriers and facilitators to the delivery of evidence-based PT from patient and provider perspectives. Objective 1 will survey expert physician/referrers and expert physical therapists for people with Parkinson's disease to describe their PT-related referral and practice decisions across the stages of the disease. The results of this survey will be mapped onto existing guidelines to evaluate conformity with evidence-based practice. Objective 2 will use focus groups and key informant interviews of people with Parkinson's disease, physical therapists, and physicians to explain how current practice is similar or different from evidence-based practice. The focus group and interview questions will probe for barriers and facilitators to the delivery of evidence-based PT services within the US healthcare context. The results of these studies promote improved synthesis of evidence into healthcare delivery and form the basis for future implementation or knowledge translation efforts to improve the quality of PT delivery. These research goals are aligned with AHRQ's 2014-2018 Strategic Plan goal 1B to ?improve healthcare quality,? goal 1E to ensure access to ?quality, culturally competent care, including long-term services and supports for vulnerable populations,? and goal 3C to ?improve the accessibility and quality of supportive services for people with disabilities and older adults.? The final outcomes of these studies are to develop implementation strategies to improve the delivery of high-quality, evidence-based PT for people with Parkinson's disease.", ,,,

,9512003,"Project Summary/Abstract. Nighttime agitation, defined as the appearance or exacerbation of behavioral disturbances, such as wandering and aggression, in the afternoon and/or evening, is a prevalent symptom in persons with Alzheimer?s disease that reduces their quality of life and restricts their environments. Effective treatments are lacking. One major cause for past failure of treatments has been the approach of treating all nighttime agitation alike. Unlike interventions in the past, our precision medicine approach tailors the intervention to a specific sleep disorder, restless legs syndrome (RLS). RLS occurs in 10-14% of older adults and it is likely that persons with Alzheimer?s disease have RLS, since it is quite common, but it is infrequently identified because diagnosis is dependent on patients answering complex questions about their symptoms. RLS causes an urge to move associated with uncomfortable and unpleasant leg sensations. The urge to move and leg discomfort only occur or worsen at night, and relief is by movement. We hypothesized that RLS might be an etiology for nighttime agitation because: 1) circadian patterns of nighttime agitation and RLS symptoms are almost identical; 2) unrelieved RLS discomfort may precipitate behaviors such as screaming and requests for help, and the urge to move may cause wandering, pacing, and restlessness; and 3) factors common in institutionalized persons with Alzheimer?s disease, such as anemia, prolonged bed rest, and antidepressants, trigger or worsen RLS. Our preliminary work supports our hypothesis, and provides beginning evidence that RLS may be an unidentified etiology for nighttime agitation. In 59 persons with dementia and nighttime agitation, and RLS diagnosed using objective measures, we found that almost ¼ had RLS and that RLS was associated with nighttime agitation (r = 0.31, p .01). We now propose a pilot clinical trial to determine if RLS treatment reduces nighttime agitation, improves sleep, reduces antipsychotic medications, and the mechanism for these effects. We have chosen gabapentin enacarbil (GEn) as the treatment because it is FDA approved for RLS and has a favorable safety profile. We propose an 8-week, double-blind placebo-controlled randomized pilot trial of GEn versus placebo in 136 nursing home residents with moderate to severe Alzheimer?s disease, nighttime agitation, and RLS, followed by an 8-week post-trial evaluation of antipsychotic medication use. The specific aims are to: 1) Determine the effect of GEn, compared to placebo on nighttime agitation (primary endpoint); 2) Describe the safety profile of GEn compared to placebo in this population; 3) Estimate the effect size of GEn compared to placebo on nighttime sleep, RLS behaviors, and antipsychotic medications; 4) Explore whether frequency of RLS behaviors mediates the effect of GEn on nighttime agitation behaviors. The results of this study and future definitive trials may shift and improve standards of care for treatment of nighttime agitation; reduce elopement, aggression, and other nighttime agitation behaviors; and improve sleep.", ,,,
,9368557,"Project Summary/Abstract  The long-term goal of this proposal is to better understand how T cells defend against pathogens and eradicate cancerous cells within our bodies. To achieve this goal, T cells continuously crawl seeking evidence of foreign peptide fragments on the surface of other cells. Once the T cell encounters a target cell with foreign or mutant peptides, then it initiates activation mechanisms that unleash a potent immune response. Malfunctions in T cell activation are linked with autoimmune disease, while drugs that enhance T cell activation are used to treat cancer. Therefore, there is much interest in understanding the molecular mechanisms of T cell activation. The very first step in T cell activation involves recognition between the T cell receptor (TCR) and the short peptides (8-11 amino acids) presented by the major histocompatibility complex (pMHC) protein. Because T cells are highly migratory and antigen recognition occurs when the T cell physically contacts a target cell, there are long standing questions of whether T cells transmit defined forces to their TCR complex and if chemo-mechanical coupling influences immune function. These questions cannot be answered using conventional imaging approaches. The central hypothesis of the proposed work is that advanced mechano- imaging and mechano-analytical approaches will reveal the TCR forces involved in regulation of T cell signaling. Building on our recent breakthroughs in developing high-resolution imaging approaches to map the forces transmitted by cell surface receptors, we will aim to close this gap in our understanding and unravel the mechanical basis of T cell activation. Our preliminary data clearly shows that we have successfully developed the first molecular probes to image the piconewton forces transmitted by the TCR to its ligand during TCR activation. We will test the central hypothesis by first developing molecular force microscopy for the TCR. These probes will test whether the TCR is an anisotropic mechanosensor as proposed in the literature. Next we will map TCR forces within membrane-membrane junctions where the receptor is free to assemble into signaling microclusters. Fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM) and ratiometric probes will be used to map these forces in space and time. Finally, we will use mechanically-triggered enzymes to quantify TCR forces with ultrahigh sensitivity and to tag proximal molecules that are recruited following transmission of TCR forces. The work requires multidisciplinary approaches combining expertise from three investigators that cover the areas of biophysical chemistry, cell biology, and molecular immunology. Importantly, not only will the imaging and quantification techniques developed for this proposal be critical for better understanding the specificity of the adaptive immune system, we expect important implications for the optimal design and implementation of adoptive T cell transfer and chimeric antigen receptors (CARs) in immunotherapy as well as understanding the causes of autoimmune disease.", ,,,
,9357042,"DEVELOPMENTAL RESEARCH PROGRAM SUMMARY The Developmental Research Program (DRP) will act as an incubator for high-risk/high-gain and novel collaborative projects within the Weill Cornell Medicine (WCM) SPORE in Prostate Cancer (PCa). Each DRP project will require one-to-two years of development time and funds to facilitate compelling preliminary data. To this end, the WCM SPORE will establish a DRP that will address 1) develop infrastructure to solicit competitive developmental projects across the Weill Cornell and Columbia University campuses, 2) facilitate evaluation of proposals for the DRP, and 3) implement procedures for a developmental project to replace an existing major SPORE Project. Led by Dr. Lewis Cantley, Dr. David Nanus, and Dr. Paraskevi Giannakakou, the DRP for the WCM SPORE will distribute announcements using broadcast email systems in place at both universities to solicit highly competitive pilot project proposals spanning wide areas of disciplines beyond traditional biomedical research. We anticipate populating the DRP with up to two new pilot projects per year and will support up to four (4) pilot projects concurrently. The DRP will be also be used as pipeline for competitive developmental projects to fill whichever vacant slots for major SPORE Projects. The SPORE Principal Investigator, Internal Advisory Board (IAB) and DRP co-Directors will make use of regularly scheduled meetings to ensure major projects are evaluated at least twice a year. Of note, the External Advisory Board (EAB) will be consulted annually on projects related to the DRP. Regular bi-monthly meetings and additional closed meetings with Co-Leaders of the major Projects and developmental projects will help determine if and when implementation of a new major Project is required. The DRP is a vital aspect of a highly productive SPORE program to ensure innovative developmental projects are available to replace major projects and to advance the SPORE's overall translational goals.", ,,,
,9331418,"Gonorrhea and chlamydia are the most common bacterial sexually transmitted infections worldwide and  adversely impact the reproductive health of women. In addition to complications such as pelvic inflammatory  disease and tubal scarring with consequent infertility or ectopic pregnancy, they enhance HIV transmission.  Gonorrhea and chlamydia frequently exist as coinfections. The gonococcus has displayed a remarkable ability  to become resistant to every antibiotic that it has encountered. The emergence of Neisseria gonorrhoeae (Ng)  strains that are resistant to third-generation cephalosporins has heralded an era of untreatable gonorrhea.  Vaccines and novel therapeutics against Ng are needed urgently. Our group has developed a gonococcal  vaccine candidate that comprises a peptide mimic (a 'mimitope') of a Ng lipooligosaccharide epitope that is  expressed by >95% of strains in vivo. This mimitope, when configured as a multi-antigen peptide vaccine,  decreases Ng burden in the mouse vaginal colonization model. Based on our working knowledge of  interactions of the complement (C) inhibitor factor H (fH) with Ng, we have fused the A/g-binding domains of fH  to IgG Fc to create a novel immunotherapeutic, called fH/Fc. A point mutation introduced in the fH fragment of  fH/Fc abrogated C'-mediated lysis of host cells, yet allowed fH/Fc to bind to, activate C on and kill drug-resistant  Ng. Elucidating factors that facilitate Ng transmission and gaining a global understanding of host  responses are critical for developing safe and effective vaccines and therapeutics against Ng. These studies  are highly relevant in context of chlamydia coinfection, a commonly encountered clinical scenario, because  chlamydia may subvert immunity to increase Ng burden that our vaccine and fH/Fc must overcome. We have  observed that certain Ng strains are transmitted far less efficiently than other closely related Ng lineages. In  Aim 1a we will compare the ability of low vs. high transmitted Ng to evade C, cationic peptides, and adhere to  and invade human endocervical cells to better understand why strains differ in their transmissibility. Ongoing  data analysis of Ng infected men and their female partners at the Nanjing, China, STD clinic site suggest that  preexisting Chlamydia trachomatis (Ct) infection enhances the transmission of Ng from men to women. In Aim  1b we will define the role of Cf load and/or serovar in increasing Ng transmission. Mice infected with Cf suffer  a greater burden of Ng infection. Global transcriptome analyses on mice infected with Ng, Ct or dual Ng/Ct  coinfection will be performed in Aim 2a to elucidate how Cf subverts host defenses to enhance Ng infection;  these data will be compared with human transcriptome data (Genco, Project 4). The ability of our mimitope Ng  vaccine candidate to attenuate Ng in the mouse A/g/Cf coinfection model will be studied in Aim 2b. Aim 3a will  evaluate the efficacy of fH/Fc in mice infected with drug-resistant Ng alone and Ng/Ct coinfection. In Aim 3b  we will use mice that lack critical C components (C3, C5, C5a receptor) or effector arms of phagocytosis (e.g.,  PMNs, macrophages or Fc receptors) to elucidate the mechanism of action of fH/Fc in vivo.", ,,,
,9350561,"PROJECT SUMMARY The goal of this New Innovator project is to advance gene delivery applications for stem cell therapies through innovative new delivery systems designed using information gained from priming of endogenous cellular targets and telecommunications (mathematical) modeling of nonviral DNA transfer. Gene delivery requires a carrier to transport exogenous genes as plasmid DNA (pDNA) to cells to produce an encoded protein (i.e. transfection). Nonviral delivery systems have been extensively investigated as a technique to accomplish transfection, however they suffer from low efficiency, thereby limiting their application in functional genomics, tissue engineering, medical devices, and gene therapy. In particular, gene delivery to adult-derived stem cells has proven especially difficult. Empirical investigations into enhancing transfection of nonviral systems have often focused on modifications to the pDNA carrier. However, those studies have had limited successes in enhancing transfection largely due to the lack of information of the molecular factors that facilitate the delivery process, as well as an incomplete understanding of the process itself. Recently, two different approaches have been investigated by the PI to improve our understanding of the gene delivery process: pharmacogenomics screens (i.e. microarray analysis) and pharmacokinetics models. Microarray studies in the PI's laboratory have been used to profile transfected and untransfected (but treated) cell populations, providing molecular targets to enhance nonviral transfection. This project proposes to use those targets for cell priming to both increase our understanding of the role of the targets and develop simple new protocols to enhance transfection. In addition, we will identify more candidate priming agents through a screen of clinically approved drugs, which can also be analyzed for their effect on specific gene pathways, to further our understanding of the process. In parallel with previous microarray analysis efforts, computational models have been developed, providing insight into barriers and kinetic parameters of the gene transfer process. However previous models are limited in their ability to output mechanistic information. Here a novel kinetic model of gene delivery using telecommunications queuing theory will overcome challenges encountered by previous mathematical models and allow for integration of cell priming modes of transfection. In this telecommunications model, delivery of DNA to the cell nucleus is considered in the same way as the delivery of a packet of information (DNA) to a destination computer (nucleus) within a packet- switched computer network (barriers to DNA transfer). This model will allow for a priori predictions about novel transfection systems.

Reducing the percentage of heavy drinking days in individuals with alcohol use disorder is an accepted intervention target in alcohol addiction treatment, yet for other drug use disorders, complete abstinence remains the standard for demonstrating treatment efficacy. Interventions that promote reductions in drug use should improve biopsychosocial outcomes. Little research has been conducted to demonstrate benefits of reduced drug use, however. Demonstrating the benefits of reduced cocaine (COC) use would significantly advance treatment development by challenging expectations for outcomes from possible interventions. COC use produces a number of biopsychosocial detriments (e.g., cardiovascular toxicity, disrupted immune function, increased psychiatric comorbidities) that could be ameliorated by COC use reduction. No studies have prospectively or comprehensively evaluated this possibility to date, although preliminary data support this hypothesis. To fill this critical knowledge gap, we propose a randomized, controlled 12-week trial in which financial incentives will be used to reduce COC use. Subjects will be randomly assigned to one of three groups (n=66 completers/ group): 1) high value financial incentives for COC abstinence in which frequency of COC use is expected to be substantially reduced or completely eliminated, 2) low value financial incentives for COC abstinence in which frequency of COC use is expected to be reduced or 3) a non-contingent control group, in which frequency of COC use is expected to remain stable. This study aims to demonstrate that reduced COC use improves physiological and biochemical indicators of cardiovascular and immune fitness, as well as psychosocial function. The overarching hypothesis is that individuals assigned to the active treatment conditions will display improvements in biopsychosocial domains compared to individuals assigned to the non-contingent control group. A ?dose-response? is also expected whereby individuals assigned to the high value condition will display greater reductions in COC use, and consequently greater improvements, relative to the low value condition. This research will advance the field by: 1) using multifaceted health outcomes to provide prospective evidence supporting reduced drug use as a viable endpoint for COC treatment development, 2) identifying biochemical indicators of health improvements associated with reduced COC use and 3) laying the foundation for a paradigm-shifting definition of COC treatment success, thereby challenging expectations for outcomes in behavioral and pharmacological intervention development. These innovations will accelerate identification of promising treatments for cocaine use disorder, resulting in a sustained and powerful impact on scientific and clinical practice.", ,,,
,9384951,"Research Project 1. Vesicant-induced Skin Injury Key personnel: Donald Gerecke, Ph.D., Associate Professor, Rutgers University School of Pharmacy Jeffrey D. Laskin, Ph.D., Professor, Rutgers University School of Public Health Project Summary/Abstract Sulfur mustard (bis-2-chloroethyl sulfide, SM) and nitrogen mustard (bis-2-chloroethyl ethylamine, NM), are vesicants that have been adapted for use as chemical weapons; they are potent blistering agents in the skin. The overall goal of this research project is to elucidate basic mechanisms of mustard damage to the skin with the objective of identifying new targets for therapeutic intervention and drug development. We discovered a highly novel link between skin injury and inflammation induced by vesciants and the endocannabinoid system, a ubiquitous signaling system that regulates cell growth and differentiation and down regulates inflammatory responses. Endocannabinoids consist of endogenous ligands (e.g., anandamide [AEA] and 2-arachidonoyl- glycerol, [2-AG]), cannabinoid receptors (e.g., the G-protein coupled CB1 and CB2 receptors), and metabolic enzymes that regulate endocannabinoid biosynthesis (e.g., N-acyltransferases, phospholipases) and degradation (e.g., fatty acid amide hydrolase [FAAH], monoacylglycerol lipase [MAGL]). Topical application of either SM or NM to mouse skin caused a marked and persistent upregulation of expression of the endocannabinoid degrading enzyme, FAAH, and receptor proteins that bind endocannabinoids including CB1, CB2 and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-? (PPAR?). Importantly, endocannabinoids have been shown to accumulate in human skin blister fluid, suggesting that they may be involved in the pathophysiologic response to vesicants. We hypothesize that endocannabinoids regulate inflammation and wound healing in the skin following exposure to mustards and thus, the endocannabinoid system can be targeted for the development of countermeasures. Our key lead product entering advanced development is an inhibitor of FAAH. Our aims are to assess the role of the endocannabinoid system in vesicant-induced skin injury and wound healing and elucidate mechanisms by which mustards modulate keratinocyte expression of the endocannabinoid system. We will also evaluate a highly novel drug delivery system to improve efficacy of our lead compound. Our studies will provide key information on the role of endocannabinoids in the pathophysiology of vesicant-induced skin toxicity and lead to the development of more effective countermeasures.", ,,,
,9331655,"?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): An ultimate goal of vision science is to understand and predict performance under natural conditions, and there is arguably no task more ubiquitous and fundamental than visually searching the environment for objects of interest. However, little is known about search in natural scenes. Our aim is to measure, characterize, and model search performance in natural scenes in both humans and non-human primates. We will study both covert search, where the search scene is presented for a limited time and the eyes remain on a fixation target, and overt search, which involves eye movements. Our approach combines mathematical/computational analysis, psychophysical and eye-movement measurements in humans and monkeys, and voltage sensitive dye imaging (VSDI) in V1 of behaving monkeys. We argue that a rigorous understanding of visual search must begin with a characterization of the sensory factors that control the detectability of the target across the visual field in absence of any uncertainty about the location of the target. In preliminary psychophysical, neurophysiological, and computational studies we developed a model of target detectability that predicts simple detection performance in natural images. In further computational studies (based on the detection results), we discovered a biologically-plausible computation that would allow the brain to perform optimal overt search in natural scenes. Specifically, we prove that during a visual search, the optimal next fixation location is obtained from the current belief map (posterior probability map) of where the target might be located, by (i) dividing (normalizing) the map by the local image contrast, (ii) blurring this contrast-normalized map appropriately, and then (iii) selecting the peak of the blurred map as the next fixation location. The proposed studies will measure human and monkey detection and visual search performance in natural images, and will measure VSDI responses in monkeys during fixation and detection tasks. The studies will let us test and further develop our models of simple detection and covert search in natural images, and determine which components of optimal fixation search humans use when searching in natural images. They may also lead to methods for training humans to use more optimal search strategies.", ,,,
,9346639,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT High-resolution functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is an essential tool to non-invasively study human brain function. To fully utilize high-resolution fMRI application, it is crucial to establish the detailed cellular and signaling pathways for neurovascular coupling. Although our understanding of the signaling pathways has been significantly improved over the last few years, the pathways responsible for producing fMRI signal changes have not been fully clarified yet. The objective in this particular application is to determine the roles of astrocytes, a strong candidate as a neurovascular mediator, to high-resolution fMRI signal evoked by excitatory and inhibitory neuronal activity. To attain this objective, we will apply well-established multimodal techniques, including electrophysiology and fMRI, to the in vivo olfactory bulb model. The olfactory bulb is ideal to address neurovascular coupling issues since each bulb layer contains distinctive neuronal types and specific synapses, and individual layers can be preferentially activated unlike other brain regions. Our results are expected to contribute to the neural-specific interpretation of fMRI maps by revealing the roles of astrocytes in excitatory and inhibitory neuronal activity in sensory stimulation-evoked fMRI responses. Such findings should also provide insight into how neurovascular coupling is impaired in pathological conditions. Since astrocyte functions are impaired in certain diseases, defects in blood flow control may be caused by abnormal astrocyte function rather than from malfunction in neurons and vessels.", ,,,
,9355602,"1 Barrett's esophagus (BE) affects about 3.3 million adults in the United States1. A small subset of patients with  2 BE may sequentially progress from intestinal metaplasia (BIM-P) to low-grade dysplasia (LGD), high-grade  3 dysplasia (HGD) and esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC). The incidence of EAC has increased greater than 5-  4 fold over the past 4 decades in the United States2. Patients with BIM without dysplasia have a much lower  5 EAC risk than those with high-grade dysplasia. For effective health care, identification of molecular markers  6 that predict progression of BIM to HGD/EAC is highly desirable, as BIM-P may be monitored and aggressively  7 treated to inhibit progression to EAC. Our laboratory and others have identified genomic alterations that may  8 drive HGD/EAC development, including point mutations 6 and copy number changes. We found frequent (50%)  9 losses in chromosome 9p areas containing CDKN2A/p16 in BIM-P but not in non-progressors. Inactivation of 10 CDKN2A/p16 by methylation is a frequent event in BE progression to HGD/EAC7-9. Molecular 11 genomic/epigenomic testing of surveillance biopsies may identify candidate high-risk BIM patients for closer 12 surveillance and chemoprevention of HGD/EAC. We propose a combination of demethylating agents to 13 reverse CpG methylation in p16 and other genes that may contribute to neoplastic progression with anti- 14 inflammatory drugs, which have been shown to reduce HGD/EAC development 13 14. Our hypothesis is that 15 the CDKN2A gene product p16 is key in determining disease progression in a large number of those 16 BE patients who develop dysplasia/EAC and that detection of CDKN2A/p16 alterations and/or 17 molecular genomic, epigenetic and expression alterations that result from CDKN2A/p16 inactivation 18 may be used to direct early therapeutic intervention to prevent EAC development. We will address this 19 hypothesis in three specific aims. Aim 1: To characterize the global transcriptomic alterations that result 20 from CDKN2A/p16 genomic and epigenetic inactivation, leading to evasion from senescence and increased 21 proliferation, in patients with BE who progress to HGD/EAC. These alterations will permit the identification of 22 molecular pathways, potential novel treatment targets and biomarkers of high-risk BIM patients, who are 23 candidates for intervention therapy (such as demethylating and anti-inflammatory drugs) to prevent HGD/EAC. 24 Aim 2: To investigate the role of CDKN2A/p16 in esophageal dysplasia and adenocarcinoma development and 25 progression in mouse models of esophageal Barrett's-like metaplasia progressing to HGD/EAC. Aim 3: To 26 investigate the effect of demethylating and anti-inflammatory drugs in the context of active and inactive 27 CDKN2A/p16, in the development of esophageal dysplasia and adenocarcinoma in the established mouse 28 models. To characterize the comprehensive transcriptomic alterations that result from CDKN2A/p16 29 inactivation, in mice with BE-like lesions that progress to HGD/EAC under effect of treatment vs. no treatment. 30 Transcriptomic mouse data will be compared with data from human tissues tested in aim 1.", ,,,
,9335899,"Project Summary:  Compounds containing chiral centers that are remotely located from other functional groups are commonly found in biologically active compounds. However, the enantioselective synthesis of such chiral centers is challenging and, thus, developing new methods to streamline their access are in high demand. Therefore, we are targeting a new collection of alkene functionalization processes, which enable site and enantioselective addition reactions of relatively electronically unbiased multi-substituted alkenes. To accomplish this, we will exploit palladium catalysis through a unique mechanistic process in which, after initial addition of the Pd- organometallic species to the alkene, the catalyst migrates through an alkyl chain to ultimately oxidize a distant functional group. Therefore, this approach provides a comprehensive strategy to streamline the enantioselective synthesis of building blocks incorporating remote tertiary and quaternary chiral centers that are positioned at nearly any distance from the pendant preexisting functional group. The method development is coupled to careful mechanistic studies, which are designed to elucidate the fundamental features governing reaction outcomes, as well as to stimulate new reaction development and catalyst design. In this context, the current renewal application is focused on a) determining if other coupling partners besides aryl boronic acids can be used in a site and enantioselective manner including alkenyl (Aim 1) and alkyl groups (Aim 2) as well as direct coupling of electron-rich heteroaromatic systems (Aim 1), b) expanding the types of alkenes used to more challenging examples, including 1,1-disubstituted variants, which set a chiral center ? to the site of addition, and tetrasubstituted alkenes, which allow for the formation of vicinal chiral centers but have not been a competent substrate class in intermolecular Heck reactions (Aim 1), c) evaluating other functional groups remotely attached to the alkene, which allow for the formation of unique products as well as tests remote electronic effects on site selectivity (Aim 2), and d) pursuing the concept of setting multiple chiral centers at distant sites through alkene difunctionalization reactions (Aim 3).", ,,,
,9322609,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Behavioral flexibility is a fundamental cognitive capacity in all mammals. When our environments change, we must be able to adapt our actions. For example, after frequenting a particular restaurant for some time, we recall the precise route and associate this with our favorite dish. However, sometimes circumstances change-the restaurant may change locations-and we must adapt an action (the route we take) in order to receive the same outcome (our favorite dish). A deficit in this capacity is observed in numerous psychiatric disorders including drug addiction, schizophrenia, and obsessive-compulsive disorder and these impairments are generally resistant to treatment. In order to develop improved therapeutics and diagnostic tools, a deeper understanding of the mechanisms underlying impaired behavioral flexibility is necessary. Functional imaging studies in humans as well as lesion studies across species have linked the prefrontal cortex (PFC) with cognitive functions including flexible behavior. However, this brain region does not work in isolation; rather it is part of a larger circuit connecting other structures including the mediodorsal thalamu (MD). Indeed, functional imaging studies show that the MD is important for flexible behavior. However, with imaging studies, causal relationships cannot be determined. Therefore, animal models must be implemented in order to examine the effect of direct manipulation of brain activity. In order to determine whether the MD causally supports flexible behavior, we recently created a mouse model with decreased MD activity and showed that this manipulation led to impairments in behavioral flexibility. However, behavioral flexibility requires multiple cognitive processes. Not only must an organism associate an action with an outcome, but it must also recognize the environmental stimuli that lead to that outcome. Therefore, we next examined the effect of decreasing MD activity during tasks assessing these elementary cognitive processes. We found that the MD plays a role in the formation of action-outcome associations as well as the use of Pavlovian stimuli to shape future actions. These findings establish a role of the MD in specific cognitive processes underlying flexible behavior. However, the MD is part of a larger neural circuit described above. Thus, the roles of specific MD inputs and outputs in the elementary cognitive processes of flexible behavior remain unknown. This proposal implements novel techniques to reversibly manipulate brain activity in the mouse in order to identify the MD neuronal circuitry supporting flexible behavior. The knowledge gained from these studies will aid in the development of new therapeutic strategies.", ,,,
,9356486,"Summary  Salivary gland dysfunction affects millions of Americans whose quality of life is severely impacted by dry mouth, oral bacterial infections, poor nutrition and other disorders associated with decreased saliva production. Loss of saliva is symptomatic of Sjögren's syndrome (SS), an autoimmune disease associated with lymphocytic infiltration of the salivary gland, autoantibody production and ultimately tissue degeneration. A commonality between many human autoimmune diseases, including SS, is chronic inflammation whereby sustained accumulation of immune cells promotes tissue degeneration and often leads to other damaging effects including tissue fibrosis, secondary autoimmune diseases (e.g. lupus, rheumatoid arthritis) and the development of lymphoma. A major focus of this proposal is to identify the functional relevance of ?alarmones? that are produced at the site of initial tissue damage and the cellular mechanisms whereby alarmones mobilize the systemic immune system leading to chronic inflammation. Among possible alarmones that initiate autoimmune disease in salivary glands, our laboratory has investigated the effect of localized release of nucleotides, such as ATP, from damaged cells or tissues. We have shown that G protein-coupled P2Y2 receptors (P2Y2R) for ATP and UTP are early responders to released nucleotide alarmones and that knockout of the P2Y2R in a mouse model of SS prevents infiltration of B and T lymphocytes into salivary glands, indicating a loss of the systemic immune response. We hypothesize that chronic inflammation occurs through P2Y2R activation in SS salivary glands, which increases localized chemokine/cytokine levels and attracts peripheral lymphocyte infiltration across the vascular endothelium into salivary glands. Specific Aims will fully investigate the cell-specific mechanisms that initiate chronic inflammation at the level of P2Y2 receptors in the salivary gland of SS mouse models and test the potential of targeting the P2Y2R in SS mouse models to prevent a systemic immune response. Specific Aim 1 will address the hypothesis that P2Y2R activation in B and T cells promotes their infiltration and proliferation in salivary glands of SS mouse models thereby contributing to salivary gland dysfunction. Specific Aim 2 will address the hypothesis that P2Y2R upregulation in salivary epithelium and vascular endothelium contributes to the autoimmune phenotype in SS mouse models. Specific Aim 3 will evaluate the hypothesis that pharmacological antagonism of P2Y2Rs in vivo reduces chronic inflammation of the salivary glands in two distinct SS mouse models. Successful completion of this project would expedite human studies to target modulation of the P2Y2R in SS to prevent loss of salivary gland function.", ,,,

,9242830,"Project Summary The importance of preserving renal function during surgical interventions through nephron-sparing (?partial nephrectomy?) surgical techniques has garnered considerable and growing recent recognition. Total kidney removal (?radical nephrectomy?) permanently compromises renal function and leads to increased morbidity and mortality, with substantial negative impact on long-term patient quality of life. In contrast, partial nephrectomy improves long-term outcomes by sparing a maximal amount of healthy kidney tissue. However, minimally invasive partial nephrectomy is rarely attempted because it is extremely challenging to accomplish. The surgeon must make critical intraoperative decisions (which can mean life or death for the patient), based on imprecisely mentally inferred and registered three-dimensional anatomical relationships. The surgeon must view a series of 2D preoperative images and build a mental 3D model of patient anatomy. He/she must then intraoperatively guess how this remembered anatomical map should be registered to the patient. The inherent inaccuracies in this process prevent many surgeons from attempting minimally invasive partial nephrectomy, since positive margins (or inadvertent damage to internal kidney structures) are disastrous outcomes, while taking a large negative margin defeats the purpose of the partial nephrectomy procedure.  Our overall goal is to create an image-guided surgical system that makes localization, dissection, and isolation of critical vascular and organ structures, as well as correct margin selection, easier and more accurate for the surgeon (and thus the procedure safer and more effective for the patient), thereby increasing the number of surgeons and hospitals able to adopt nephron sparing techniques. Toward this goal, our specific objective in this proposal is to test the hypothesis that image guidance can increase the accuracy and/or time- efficiency of the surgery. To test this hypothesis, we propose three Specific Aims: Aim 1 implements image guidance on the da Vinci surgical robot platform. Aim 2 addresses extensive phantom validation studies using anatomically accurate synthetic organs with realistic material properties. Aim 3 consists of an in vivo human subject pilot study we call a ?bystander study? because it can be achieved with essentially zero risk to human subjects. The endpoint of this R01 will be a fully validated system, and the necessary experimental data to power a large-scale clinical comparative efficacy study. This study will be able to take place soon after the conclusion of this R01, due to the wide availability of the da Vinci robot, and the fact that all a surgeon or hospital must have to participate is the robot itself ? no additional pieces of equipment or infrastructural changes will be necessary.", ,,,
,9471732,"ABSTRACT The overall goal of this proposal is to evaluate cartilage composition of patients with hip osteoarthritis (OA) using advanced MRI techniques, and determine their relationship to development of cartilage lesions, patient function, and changes in hip kinematics and kinetics during functional tasks. The central hypothesis is that early changes in cartilage biochemistry and altered hip biomechanics are associated with progression of hip OA defined by worsening patient-reported outcomes and higher cartilage lesion scores. To accomplish this we need to establish the cross-sectional relationship of these metrics and natural history of hip OA over three years with the following specific aims: Aim I) To characterize hip cartilage T1? and T2 relaxation time, their spatial heterogeneity and anatomical location, and association of hip geometry (i.e. alpha angle, acetabular depth, etc), as a function of (I.A) KL grade and (I.B) annual follow-up time (Years 0-3); Aim II) To determine the relationship between hip cartilage composition (measured by MR T1? and T2 relaxation time, spatial heterogeneity, their anatomical location - Aim I outcomes) and disease progression as measured by (IIA) hip joint morphology (see Fig. 1- semi-quantitative MR grading1, adjusted for hip geometry such as alpha angle) and (IIB) patient reported outcomes (as determined by HOOS15); and Aim III) To determine the relationship between hip cartilage composition (measured by MRI T1? and T2 relaxation time, Aim I outcomes), and sagittal plane hip kinematics and kinetics during functional tasks (peak hip flexion angle and peak hip extension moments during gait, stairs, and sit-to-stand). A total of 144 hips across a range of OA severity will be included in the study. Advanced quantitative imaging, motion analysis, and functional testing will be performed annually over three years (baseline, 1, 2, and 3 year follow-up). This comprehensive evaluation of the associations of hip cartilage relaxation times, lesion prevalence, and biomechanics is the vital first step to determine the natural history of hip OA using non-invasive assessment. This information forms the crux of what is needed to design and assess the effectiveness of conservative (gait retraining, muscle strengthening), disease modifying drugs, and surgical (femoral and pelvic osteotomy, etc.) interventions at slowing or reversing the disease process.", ,,,
,9304774,"Project Summary The voice is integral to human communication, yet over 7.5 million people in the United States report difficulty with their voices. Individuals with voice disorders may experience physical or emotional stress, and an overall decreased quality of life as a consequence of the disorder. The direct health-care costs for the diagnosis and treatment of these voice disorders are estimated at $11.9-$13.5 billion annu- ally. Unfortunately, an estimated 28,000 Americans are dependent on their voices for their profession. The vocal demands of these occupational voice users increase not only the individual?s risk for develop- ing vocal pathologies, but also the professional and socioeconomic consequences of developing such a disorder. Thus, voice disorders are a significant public health concern and an area of high importance to the National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders (NIDCD). The current research plan aims to determine the impact of phonotrauma on laryngeal function using an established in vivo rabbit phonation model. Aim 1 will investigate how normal laryngeal function changes in response to increased time-doses of raised intensity phonation. Aim 2 will extend the investigation to include measurement of the recovery of normal vibratory function after phonotrauma. Together, these aims will investigate the development of vibratory irregularities and recovery of laryngeal function after acute phonotrauma. The significance of the proposed research plan is that it will provide physiologic data to determine (a) the effects of phonotrauma on functional tissue outcomes, and (b) the effects of increased magnitude-doses of vibration exposure on recovery of normal vibratory function after phonotrauma. If the aims are accomplished, these findings will be used to provide empirical data to support recommen- dations regarding voice use and profiles of normal tissue recovery.", ,,,
,9467839,"Project Summary  Complex biological systems are composed of diverse units, a feature which is exemplified throughout the brain. This diversity is evident at each scale from animal behavior, to distinct brain regions, to local circuit responses, to distinct cell types and their unique morphologies, to the diverse protein expression patterns and subcellular localization of those proteins. Reductionist theory suggests that understanding the diversity of the most basic building blocks will ultimately inform our understanding of differences in animal behavior. However, linking knowledge of diversity in protein expression to diverse behavior is challenging. Here we propose an experimental and computational approach to linking mechanisms of diversity between cells to how a given cell performs a computation - particularly to how that cell encodes specific features of a stimulus. We will use the mammalian olfactory bulb as a model system to probe how sensory information is encoded by its two main projection neuron types, mitral cells (MCs) and tufted cells (TCs).  Our lab has previously demonstrated that cell-to-cell diversity of physiological properties within MCs increases the information transferred by a population of MCs, enhances its range of stimulus encoding, and limits its neural synchronization. However, the mechanisms that underlie the diversity within MCs are poorly understood. Whereas our lab and others have demonstrated diverse ion channel expression within MCs, the relationship between diverse ion channel expression and differential sensitivity to specific stimulus features has not been established. Importantly, understanding of this link is not established in any cell type across the brain. Yet, this link is essential to comprehend how the collection of ion channels in a cell create the emergent property of single neuron computation.  Here we propose to test our central hypothesis that differences in functional ion channel expression within and between MCs and TCs govern the differential sensitivity to specific stimulus features across these cells. In Aim 1, we will determine the mechanisms of diversity within and between MCs and TCs. We will measure diversity across cells using a recently developed experimental and computational approach to creating biophysical models. We predict that levels of functional ion channel expression will covary across cells. In Aim 2, we will determine the role of the diversity of ion channel expression in stimulus encoding. We will use statistical approaches to determine how diverse functional ion channel expression relates to encoding of specific stimulus features and test novel hypotheses with recordings from MCs and TCs.", ,,,
,9367017,"The counter balancing of pro- and anti-inflammatory gene transcription is crucial for normal homeostasis after septic tissue injury. Aberrant regulation of this transcriptional balance culminates in an unchecked systemic inflammation, leading to lung tissue damage and edema, respiratory failure and ultimately death. However, the exact mechanisms underlying pathological inflammation in sepsis are poorly understood, and thus the strategies to accelerate the resolution of sepsis are very limited. Studies in the proposal will test the novel hypothesis that pathogenic signaling caused by sepsis is the result of a macrophage-specific Fra-1/AP-1 restricted expression of anti- inflammatory A20, a crucial ubiquitin-editing enzyme that terminates uncontrolled activation of NF- ?B and MAP kinase signaling. Our preliminary studies, using three pre-clinical models of sepsis, showed that Fra-1 as a crucial mediator of pro-inflammatory responses in sepsis. Endotoxemia (LPS)- and pseudomonas pneumonia-induced lung injury and inflammation are markedly lower in Fra-1-deficient mice than wild-type counterparts. Fra-1-deficient mice subjected to injurious dose of i.t bacterial endotoxin (LPS), showed an accelerated resolution of lung injury compared to wild-type mice. We found increased expression of Fra-1 largely in alveolar macrophages of cadaveric lungs infected with E. coli ex vivo and in mice exposed to LPS. Importantly, mice lacking Fra-1 in myeloid cells survived longer than wild-type mice from septic shock and polymicrobial sepsis. In preliminary studies, we found reduced levels of LPS-induced NF-?B activation and an increased expression of A20 in Fra-1-deficient macrophages. A20 haplo-sufficiency in humans and in mice is associated with heightened levels of systemic inflammation. We will address the specific hypothesis that in the settings of chronic or pathological sepsis Fra-1 activation secondary to microbial insults restricts optimal A20 expression and triggers pro-inflammatory response, thereby impairing the resolution of sepsis. We will use physiological and molecular approaches and tissue-specific knockout mice and preclinical models of sepsis to test this hypothesis. The specific aims of the proposal are to: 1) Determine the role and mechanisms of macrophage-specific Fra-1 signaling in mediating sustained lung injury in pseudomonas pneumonia and sepsis, and 2) Examine the mechanisms by which Fra-1 restricts A20 transcriptional induction by microbial insults in macrophages, and determine that Fra-1 restricted A20 signaling is a causative factor of persistent lung injury in sepsis. The proposed studies will identify novel insights and targets for therapies to accelerate lung injury repair in patients with pseudomonas pneumonia and sepsis.", ,,,

It will address the two major problems with existing MMMs: 1. Limited field of view due to aberrations induced by the intermediate optics 2. Loss of emission photons in the descanned path. We will present details of a new excitation scheme that avoids aberrations and restricted field of views, and describe a non-descanned detection scheme that employs a high efficiency fiber coupled detection with an original interlaced scanning strategy that minimizes foci crosstalk. This proposal overcomes several long standing technical problems with MMM systems for deep tissue imaging, with a novel MMM design ideally suited for ex vivo whole organ imaging.

,9342755,"Project Summary: Despite impressive therapeutic advances in the treatment of CLL over the past decade, relapsed tumors that are often resistant to known therapies remain a problem. Understanding resistance and developing new treatment strategies will be necessary to turn CLL into a curable disease. With few notable exceptions, responses to chemotherapy typically occur through apoptosis, a form of programmed cell death. Our goal is to identify drugs that sensitize CLL cells to apoptosis, and to identify combinations of drugs that would prevent relapse. While chemical screening of conventional cytotoxicity is an attractive strategy to meet this goal, such an approach is impeded by the inability to reliably culture CLL cells for longer than 48 hours ex vivo. This ultimately reflects a technological gap in our ability to chemically perturb CLL ex vivo, and measure functional and clinically relevant phenotypes. Here, we will use a novel chemical screening approach called dynamic BH3 profiling (DBP), which enables functional measurements of chemically induced apoptotic changes, and requires only 6-24 hours of ex vivo culture, thereby maximizing molecular fidelity and tumor cell viability. Using a panel of over 2000 drugs, not only will we identify novel molecules that sensitize CLL cells for apoptosis, but we will also determine chemical apoptotic sensitivities that are lost or gained on relapse for individual patients. Drugs that uniquely sensitize only relapsed tumors present exciting opportunities for combination chemotherapy. Finally to understand mechanisms of apoptotic vulnerabilities in pre- and post-treatment samples, we will correlate our measurements of functional apoptotic responses with the large molecular datasets in Project 1 and 2 for at least 104 CLL patients. In sum, the successful identification of apoptotic sensitizing drugs in CLL, will not only advance our molecular understanding of CLL, but could result in truly novel therapeutic options.", ,,,
,9521446,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Treatments for systemic amyloid diseases have been held back by lack of information on the structures and causes of aggregation of the disease agents. These agents are the elongated, unbranched amyloid fibers formed by proteins having propensity for aggregation. The fibers accumulate in organs which eventually fail. In contrast, the increasingly successful attack on cancer, infectious, and metabolic diseases is rooted in part in the availability of information on the structures of the disease targets, permitting design of effective chemical interventions.  In previous work we have developed a procedure for inhibiting the formation of amyloid fibers. This first step is application of our computer algorithm which identifies the short Velcro-like sequence segments that drive formation of amyloid fibers. We have applied this algorithm to find over 100 such segments in disease- related proteins, and have verified that such segments themselves form amyloid fibers, and closely related microcrystals. The second step is X-ray structure determination of these microcrystals, which reveal the atomic basis of fiber formation. The third step is to use the resulting atomic structure as a platform for the design of inhibitors to stop fiber formation. This overall procedure is robus and ready to produce inhibitors of fibers found that cause light-chain (AL) and transthyretin (TTR) systemic amyloidosis.  In our research, we will validate particular segments of immunoglobulin light chains and transthyretin as the causes of aggregation, and based on their atomic structures, design inhibitors of aggregation. These inhibitors will be tested for their abilty to halt fiber formation in vitro, and in animal models. In principle, the same methods can be used to develop inhibitors for other systemic amyloid diseases.", ,,,

,9326838,"Project Abstract The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is announcing the availability of cooperative agreements (RFA-FD-16-021) to State government animal derived food prevention programs. The intent of these agreements is to fund training and outreach programs for individuals and parties involved with medicating animals intended for food, including support of education and outreach activities related to extralabel drug use requirements and other prevention activities. The Minnesota Department of Agriculture (MDA) has regulatory oversight for animal feed, dairy, meat and egg products. As such, the MDA has extensive opportunity to conduct outreach and educational activities focused on veterinary drug residue prevention and extralabel drug use regulations. In addition, the MDA has subject-matter expertise in terms of veterinary leadership and technical skills in veterinary drug use and extralabel requirements, as well as experience in residue investigation and response through its extensive participation in tissue residue and milk residue investigations. As a part of this application, the MDA intends to develop and implement a Minnesota drug residue prevention program that includes creation and enhancement of outreach materials, conducting outreach and educational events and the development and maintenance of a scalable web-based training module.

,9410305,"Abstract  The goal of Mission Bio, Inc. is to develop instrumentation that will accelerate the investigation of cellular heterogeneity relevant to human health by rapidly and accurately analyzing nucleic acids from single- cells. The impact of cellular heterogeneity on biological function and disease is crucially important to a variety of questions in oncology, immunology, stem cell biology and infectious disease. Through the analysis of individual cells within a mixed population, it is possible to identify unique cell populations or cell states critical to human health and development, that are otherwise unobservable by ensemble measurements.  In proof-of-concept work, we developed a new single-cell sequencing technology, Mosaic, which is highly differentiated from existing approaches. Mosaic performs molecular barcoding on the nucleic acids of thousands of individual cells confined to microfluidic droplets. Following bulk sequencing, the molecular barcodes are used to reassemble in silico the genetic or transcriptional profiles associated with individual cells. The principal advantage of the Mosaic platform is the unique ability to perform multi-step droplet processing to prepare genomic DNA or RNA for efficient molecular barcoding. No technology with similar sequencing capability and throughput currently exists in the marketplace.  The intellectual merits of the Mosaic approach stem from the core ability to deliver a rapid and low-cost solution for massively parallel single-cell genome and transcriptome analysis on large heterogeneous populations of cells. Commercialization of the Mosaic system will enable a more detailed and comprehensive analysis of the genomes and transcriptomes of these rare cell populations. Our objective in this Phase II proposal is to take the basic Mosaic platform and ready it for commercialization by further optimizing numerous critical performance metrics such as allele dropout rates, sequence error rates and multiplexing capability. We will also fully validate the Mosaic approach for a clinically relevant application investigating genetic variation in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Mosaic relies on demonstrated microfluidics and a solid foundation of intellectual property. Phase II funding will result in a needed and technically achievable research and diagnostic tool with high impact potential in the biomedical marketplace.", ,,,
,9328040,"We are proposing to establish a Vermont Center on Tobacco Regulatory Science (VCTRS) at the  University of Vermont (UVM) in collaboration with colleagues from Brown University, Johns Hopkins University,  University of Minnesota, and University of Pittsburgh. The VCTRS will focus on researching the effects of new  tobacco products in vulnerable populations, with special emphasis on reducing the addiction potential of  cigarettes and other tobacco products by reducing their nicotine content and examining the impact of these  products on biomarkers of exposure and health outcomes. Each of these foci was selected to address  crosscutting and specific priorities of the FDA outlined in RFA-DA-13-003. We will establish an administrative  core at UVM that will provide the senior scientific and administrative leadership and support that is essential to  a vibrant and successful multidisciplinary center of research excellence. We are proposing three primary  research projects that will be complemented by a program of developmental research. In addition to this  research mission, the VCTRS will also establish a predoctoral and postdoctoral training program in tobacco  regulatory science that will be primarily located at UVM but will also include training at Brown University and  Johns Hopkins University. The research and training missions will be led by experts in addictions research in  collaboration with accomplished experts in biomarkers and health outcomes from the disciplines of  biochemistry, family practice, internal medicine, and obstetrics and gynecology. There is strong institutional  support for establishing the VCTRS at UVM that runs from the departmental level through the highest  administrative offices and extending out into key Vermont state offices that are involved in establishing and  implementing the state's tobacco control policies (see Letters of Support). Below we expound on each of  these key aspects of establishing the VCTRS. One other point that we want to mention now, and expound  upon below, is our plan to study the potential of very low nicotine content (VLNC) cigarettes for reducing the  abuse liability of cigarettes. This should not be confused with earlier failed efforts to develop light cigarettes  for the same purpose. VLNC cigarettes actually have lower nicotine content as opposed to the earlier  ineffective strategy of keeping nicotine content the same and attempting to lower nicotine yield through  ventilation, which smokers often circumvented with compensatory smoking. These are different strategies and,  while still limited, the evidence on VLNC cigarettes lowering the abuse liability of cigarettes is quite promising.", ,,,
,9287758,"?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):        Cardiovascular disease (CVD) accounts for the deaths of approximately 1 million Americans annually. Despite advances in modern medicine that have led to numerous treatment options, CVD has remained the leading cause of mortality in the US for over 80 years. Atherosclerosis, the most common form of CVD, is a disease of sterile inflammation characterized by accumulation of plaque in the arteries. It is thought that atherosclerosis is initiated by entry an sequestration of low density lipoproteins (LDL) in the vasculature where they subsequently become oxidized (oxLDL) and cause damage to local tissue. This results in the recruitment of antigen presenting cells (APCs) including dendritic cells (DCs) and macrophages. Following APC activation, an inflammatory cascade ensues, ultimately leading to an adaptive immune response and antibody production. While titers of antibodies to oxLDL and the resulting immune complexes (oxLDL-ICs) are known to correlate with disease severity, it is unknown if oxLDL-ICs play a role in disease pathogenesis. ICs can regulate inflammation in atherosclerosis by interacting with Fc gamma receptors (Fc?Rs) expressed on the surface of DCs. Activating (Fc?RI/III) and inhibitory (Fc?RIIb) Fc?Rs mediate opposing functions in DCs, shifting the balance between pro-inflammatory DC activation and tolerogenic responses. Fc?R signaling has been linked to Toll like receptor-4 (TLR-4), a pattern recognition receptor that can recognize free oxLDL. Furthermore, our preliminary data using a TLR-4 inhibitor suggest that oxLDL-ICs are able to signal through this receptor. Given that both oxLDL-ICs and DCs expressing TLR-4 have been observed in human atherosclerotic plaques, it is likely that oxLDL-IC signaling via the TLR-4 pathway and modulation of this pathway by Fc?Rs are important in disease progression. Studies in macrophage cell lines have shown increased cellular activation following treatment with oxLDL-ICs. However, the role of DCs in this process is largely unstudied, and reports regarding the in vivo relevance are lacking. Given the potent ability of DCs to elicit a downstream immune response, understanding oxLDL-IC-mediated DC activation will fill a gap in our knowledge of CVD pathogenesis and provide new avenues for therapeutic intervention. Using both in vitro and in vivo models, the long term goal of this study is to provide a clear and comprehensive answer to this critical and long-standing question in the field of atherosclerosis. We hypothesize that 1) oxLDL-ICs augment TLR-4-mediated DC inflammatory responses leading to proatherogenic T cell differentiation and 2) the inhibitory Fc?RIIb protects against atherosclerosis by down-regulating DC inflammatory responses to oxLDL-ICs. To date, the effects of DC-specific Fc?RIIb signaling in atherosclerosis have not been examined. Being afforded the opportunity to test this hypothesis will allow us to make big picture conclusions regarding the role of oxLDL-ICs in CVD. Understanding the pathological relevance of molecules known to accumulate and positively correlate with CVD severity is vital, and this avenue of research has important therapeutic potential for Veterans. Approximately 25% of the more than 8 million current Veterans Affairs (VA) medical system users suffer from ischemic heart disease due to atherosclerosis. This is alarming, especially considering that atherosclerosis is a disease for which no cure exists, despite over 50 years of active research on the subject. [In addition, increased risk for atherosclerosis is associated with PTSD and injuries resulting in amputation. Given the growing number of Veterans suffering from both of these clinical complications the need to understand basic mechanisms of atherosclerosis is crucial.] Therefore, it is imperative that we continue to identify therapeutic targets in order to provide a basis for cutting edge treatments for CVD.", ,,,
,9326190,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is the most common type of leukemia in adults and has poor overall outcome because of therapy resistance and subsequent relapse. Leukemia stem cells (LSCs) that can initiate and maintain AML are considered potential sources of relapse because they are not effectively eliminated by standard chemotherapy. Our long-term goals are to define the molecular mechanism(s) regulating LSC generation and maintenance, and to identify novel mechanism-based LSC targeted therapies. One of the most common chromosome aberrations found in AML patients is inversion of chromosome 16, which creates the fusion gene CBFb-MYH11 that encodes the CBF?-SMMHC (CM) fusion protein. The objectives of this application are to define how histone deacetylase 8 (HDAC8) contributes to CM-induced AML pathogenesis, define the molecular mechanism(s) underlying HDAC8 activity and evaluate the efficacy of isoform-selective inhibitors (HDAC8i) in targeting human AML LSCs. Our central hypothesis is that HDAC8 activity is deregulated through both inv(16)-dependent and -independent mechanisms, and that aberrant HDAC8 activity contributes to AML LSC transformation and maintenance by disrupting p53 acetylation. Therefore, inhibiting HDAC8 by using HDAC8i may reactivate p53 and enhance targeting of AML LSCs. The specific aims are: 1) to define how HDAC8 contributes to inv(16)-induced AML pathogenesis and LSC maintenance, and 2) to determine the mechanism(s) underlying HDAC8 activity and the efficacy of HDAC8 isoform-selective pharmacological inhibitors in targeting non-inv(16) AML LSCs. In Specific Aim 1, we will define how CM alters HDAC8 and p53 activities; determine the role of HDAC8 in CM-induced LSC transformation and maintenance by using our conditional CM knock-in mice that also carry a new conditional Hdac8 deletion allele; and validate the findings in primary AML LSCs from inv(16)+ patients. In Specific Aim 2, we will determine the correlation between HDAC8 expression and levels of SOX4 and HOXA9 or p53 status in non-inv(16) AML LSCs; determine the functional consequences of HDAC8 overexpression and whether the HOXA9/SOX4 axis contributes to HDAC8 deregulation; and evaluate the effects of HDAC8i on p53 activity, LSC proliferation and resistance to therapy. To evaluate the function of HDAC8, we have generated mice carrying a new conditional Hdac8 deletion allele. In addition, we will use a combination of shRNA-mediated knockdown and novel pharmacological HDAC8i. The proposed studies are expected to establish molecular mechanism(s) underlying HDAC8 deregulation, as well as a novel HDAC8-mediated post-translational p53 inactivating mechanism in AML pathogenesis. In addition, these studies will reveal mechanisms of action and whether HDAC8i can reactivate p53 and enhance elimination of AML LSCs. The results will offer novel rationales and novel HDAC8 isoform-selective pharmacological inhibitors for targeted therapy, and will have translational implications for AML, as well as other cancer types in which p53 is not mutated.", ,,,
,9352838,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Type 2 diabetes (T2D) has reached epidemic proportion. Lifestyle factors such as a healthy diet are crucial for T2D prevention. Recently, the PREDIMED (PREvencion con DIeta MEDiterranea) trial was completed in Spain. The trial was a multicenter, randomized controlled trial in which 7,447 participants were randomly allocated to Mediterranean dietary interventions enriched with extra virgin olive oil or nuts or a control diet. Although the trial was primarily designed to assess the effect of the interventions on CVD, the dietary interventions also reduced incidence of T2D by 30% (95% CI 0.54-0.92). The goal of the present study is to examine whether the effects of Mediterranean diet on changes in metabolites and T2D risk. We will employ a case-cohort study design with 273 incident cases of T2D and 708 randomly selected participants free of diabetes at baseline (20%). Stored fasting blood specimens collected at baseline and at year 1 of the trial will be measured for a well-validated panel of ~300 metabolites, using the state-of-the-art LC-MS technology. Our Specific Aims are: 1) To examine the association between the baseline metabolite concentrations and the risk of T2D using a case-cohort design; 2). To examine whether the dietary interventions modify the relationships between baseline levels of metabolites and subsequent T2D risk using a case- cohort design; 3). To examine whether 1-year changes in metabolites mediate the effect of the dietary interventions on subsequent T2D outcomes from years 2 to 5 using a case-cohort design; and 4). To examine whether 1-year changes in metabolites influence insulin resistance and ?-cell function from years 2 to 5 among 708 randomly selected participants free of diabetes at baseline. The large PREDIMED trial, with archived plasma samples and rich repeated measurements of diet, lifestyle, and biomarkers, represents an unprecedented opportunity to address our specific aims in an extremely cost-effective manner. This project has great potential to advance our understanding of the metabolic pathways through which dietary interventions influence T2D risk. It also has important public health and clinical implications because many of these metabolites and their associated pathways may be suitable for direct diet and lifestyle interventions. To prepare for this project, we have already completed a preliminary study by randomly selecting 20 samples from each diet group at one year of intervention and conducted metabolomic analyses using LC-MS at the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard.", ,,,
,9353861,"?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Despite significant advances in modern medicine and drug discovery there are still tremendous unmet medical needs for combating human disease. Infectious diseases and neurodegenerative diseases contribute to global health and economic problems of significant magnitude. Traditional drug discovery efforts focused on protein inhibitors are now being complemented by more non-traditional approaches such as targeting protein-protein interactions, once considered undruggable targets. RNA and RNA-protein interactions represent further examples of non-traditional drug targets with significant potential. This is primarily due to the central role of RNA in a diverse array of biological processes ranging from information transfer (mRNA) and gene regulation (siRNA's and microRNA's) to catalysis (ribozymes and riboswitches). The siRNA pathway and the diverse world of non-coding RNA's have regulatory functions ranging from cellular differentiation and chromosomal organization to the regulation of gene expression. The ability to target RNA-dependent processes represents an important challenge at the frontier of human medicine. Although not often thought of as a target for drug discovery, RNA targeting has been very successful in the case of antibiotics such as the aminoglycosides, tetracyclines, and macrolide antibiotics. Despite these successes, our ability to rationally design molecules to target some of the most important RNA structural motifs with high affinity and specificity is essentially non- existent. This proposal aims to develop structure specific nucleic acid modulators for targeting unmet medical needs. We will apply our newly developed nucleic acid modulators to target RNA dependent processes in E. coli, a pathogen and model organism of great interest to human health and the NIH.", ,,,

,9342861,"?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project aims to determine the mechanisms underlying the regulation of a newly identified iron importer, ZIP14, and to examine its function in establishing iron homeostasis in the body. Elucidating the mechanisms of ZIP14's regulation offers opportunities to enhance our understanding of both the normal iron metabolism and the pathogenesis of iron-overload disorders. Therefore, this proposed research is directly relevant to public health and the NIH's mission. I have three and a half years of postdoctoral research experience when submitting this application. My long term career goal is to become an independent investigator at a major academic institution and to contribute to biomedical knowledge and general health improvement. I am determined to devote my career to examine the molecular basis of iron metabolism disorders and put this knowledge to use for improving the life quality of patients with these diseases. The central theme of my postdoctoral research has been the investigation of the mechanisms underlying iron-metabolism and the identification of therapeutic gene targets such that gene- specific therapies can be applied on a personalized basis. This will remain my primary objective for the foreseeable future. My central goal during the five-year span of this K99/R00 award is to achieve research independence. The mentored phase of this award offers the perfect opportunity to receive the necessary training and develop the tools needed for validation and further characterization of ZIP14. I will take advantage of the two-year mentored phase to gain additional methodological training, improve my communication skills, and enhance my management and teaching skills. I will start looking for university faculty positions towards the end of the first year of the K99 stage to ensure timely and smooth transition to the R00 phase. I will continue to work toward establishing research independence by preparing an application for R01 support during the second to the third year's transition of the independent R00 phase. The projects that I have accomplished to this point as well as my future goals regarding this subject suggest a career path that is ideal for the K99/R00 funding mechanism. In my preliminary studies, I have identified an amino acid residue that is involved in regulating the iron sensitivity of ZIP14. This residue is closely adjacent to a mutated amino acid that was recently identified in patients with brain iron overload, suggesting the existence of a potential iron sensing motif near this region. I have also found a novel proteasome-mediated pathway for the degradation of ZIP14. This pathway involves dislocation of ZIP14 from the membrane into the cell cytosol. Of note, iron prevents the extraction of ZIP14 from the membrane for proteasomal processing. Further, I found that ZIP14 ubiquitination is positively regulated by p53. However, the region that is critical in determining ZIP14's iron sensitivity, the mechanism of ZIP14's membrane dislocation, and the role of p53 in the iron- dependent regulation of ZIP14 are not known. Therefore, a more complete examination of the mechanisms underlying the iron regulation and the degradation process of ZIP14 is required. Importantly, further exploration of the contribution of ZIP14 to the pathogenesis of disorders in iron metabolism represents an ideal project from which to launch an independent research career. There are a number of preliminary experiments, assays, and reagents that need to be created and performed during the mentored phase before a full analysis of ZIP14 can be undertaken. Upon completion of these steps, the independent phase of the award will allow for complete follow-up analysis of the hypotheses generated by data during the mentored phase. Moreover, this K99/R00 award will enable me to establish a structured system for validation and characterization of the in vitro and in vivo roles of ZIP14 with which my eventual laboratory can explore new topics in iron biology.", ,,,
,9364868,"Project Summary The population is aging and according to the United States (U.S.) Census Bureau, the proportion of adults aged 65 and older is projected to grow from 15% in 2015 to 24% in 2060. This rapidly growing segment of the population constitutes a large part of the surgical care provided in the U.S. These numbers will expand in the coming years and the demand for surgery in older adults will continue to increase. Pain management is becoming an increasingly important topic in perioperative care and is of particular importance in the older adult. Very little research has been focused on pain management issues specific to older adults and is a significant research gap that the current proposal will fill. While experts agree that use of a multimodal pain plan is important for high quality surgical care of the older adult, we do not know the key components that should be included. Significantly more work is needed to develop an individualized and patient-centered multimodal pain plan for older adults undergoing surgery. The current proposal has the following three specific aims: (1) Measure the association between presence of a hospital level pain management strategy for older adults and geriatric specific outcomes of postoperative delirium and functional decline using data from the American College of Surgeons (ACS) National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (NSQIP) Geriatric Surgery Pilot Project; (2a) Develop candidate evidence-based standards for an opioid sparing multimodal pain protocol for older adults undergoing surgery; (2b) Quantify the validity and feasibility of candidate standards for an opioid sparing multimodal pain protocol using a multidisciplinary panel and the RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Methodology; (3) Pilot test an opioid sparing multimodal pain management protocol using the standards identified in Aim 2 to assess adequacy of pain control and feasibility from the patient, family member, and provider perspective. The outcome of the current proposal will be a valid and feasible opioid sparing multimodal pain management protocol. This work is important to identify the key elements of a postoperative pain management protocol specific to the unique perioperative needs of older adults. Development of an opioid sparing multimodal pain management protocol for older adults undergoing surgery will potentially minimize geriatric-specific outcomes like postoperative delirium and could ultimately be implemented at any hospital interested in improving care for older adults undergoing surgery. More attention to pain management in this vulnerable population using standardized processes of care is needed to provide safe, high quality, and patient-centered care.", ,,,

With this renewal we will further expand our program to explore and exploit the synergies between BMI and Data Science (DS). Our training program will equip trainees with not only the current DS methodology, computational approaches, and statistical methods to solve BMI problems, but also solid and broad BMI foundations, enabling them to develop novel methodologies for attacking problems currently beyond our reach. Recent advances in BMI also bring to the forefront important issues that will be emphasized in our NLMTP including the need for effective communication of biomedical information to interdisciplinary audiences of clinicians, researchers and patients. We are well prepared to train graduate students and postdocs to meet BMI challenges. Our 40 training faculty are an integral part of the Texas Medical Center and have exemplary training and research records. They have trained 194 predocs and 206 postdocs over the past 10 years, and continue to be active, with 167 predocs and 93 postdocs currently in their labs. To date our faculty have disseminated their research in more than 812 publications with their predocs, and 1,736 with their postdocs. Our predoctoral trainees will have completed one year of study and have joined a lab at one of six NLMTP participating institutions before joining the NLMTP. Our postdoctoral trainees will be selected through national recruiting and from the labs of our training faculty at those institutions. NLMTP training will combine core courses and elective courses, training in the reproducibility of research, professional/career development activities, monthly meetings with experts, and interdisciplinary co-mentored research projects to engage our 9 pre- and 6 postdoctoral trainees with a range of opportunities in health care/clinical informatics, translational bioinformatics, and clinical research informatics to prepare them for a wide range of careers as the new generation of BMI professionals.", ,,,
,9336808,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant) Abstract: The North Carolina Central University (NCCU) and the Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center (LCCC) at the University of North Carolina Chapel Hill (UNC-CH) will continue their effective and mutually beneficial partnership focusing on African-American health disparities. During the past 13 years NCI funding has firmly established the Partnership building on complementary institutional strengths, conducting molecular and population-based cancer research and training of junior faculty and students. This Comprehensive Partnership to Advance Cancer Health Equity (CPACHE) application builds upon the foundation already established through the previous U54 funding to meet the challenge of disparities in cancer incidence and mortality in North Carolina and the US through cancer research, education and community outreach. Our goals are to: (1) strengthen cancer research capacity at NCCU providing NCCU scientists mentorship and collaborative opportunities to compete for NCI grants; (2) enrich the capacity of NCCU and LCCC to further explore mechanisms underlying the disproportionate incidence of cancer mortality and morbidity between African Americans and Caucasian Americans, using both molecular and population-based approaches; (3) increase the number of NCCU scientists focused on cancer research as well as the education of minority undergraduate and graduate students in cancer research; (4) increase the faculty at the UNC LCCC focused on minority disparities research; and (5) create long-term collaborations between basic, public health, and translational scientists from NCCU and UNC LCCC. The strengths of each institution are uniquely positioned to overcome the weaknesses found in the other to achieve these priorities. Specific collaborative components of the proposal include: Two full and one pilot projects in community intervention and population science, one full and one pilot project in basic/translational cancer research in diseases with a higher incidence in African Americans, and 3 cores: Outreach, Research Education, and Histopathology. The partnership combines the expertise and resources of LCCC in population/public health sciences emphasizing disparities in North Carolina, genomics, cancer biology and cancer education and NCCU's demonstrated interest and faculty with minority health disparities research particularly in Durham NC, the state-funded NCCU units that allow faculty release from teaching and the emphasis on reaching minority populations and developing the careers of, faculty and students. These complementary institutional strengths will assure that the Partnership builds the infrastructure necessary for a lasting collaborative research, effective community outreach and a substantial contribution to our understanding of minority disparities.", ,,,
,9321279,"?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Previously, I was awarded the Outstanding Investigator award for two terms before the Program at NCI was discontinued. I have continued to be extremely productive to these days. My H index is 179 and I am one of the most cited scientists in the world. I have published more than 1000 articles in peer reviewed journals.  I have also made many important discoveries in cancer genetics and have identified and characterized many cancer genes. My discoveries that changed the ways to think about cancer, I believe, are: the demonstration of the juxtaposition of the MYC oncogene to the immunoglobulin loci and its dysregulation in Burkitt lymphoma, the first demonstration of the specific gene alterations in human cancer. The discovery of the BCL2 gene and its involvement in follicular lymphoma and in other malignancies. The Bcl2 protein is now targeted by ABT199, a drug of Abbott that causes complete remission in patients with CLL. BCL2 is the prototype of a large family of genes that control programmed cell death, or apoptosis. The discovery of ALL1, now renamed MLL1, a gene involved in more than 50 different translocations in ALL and AML. Its dysregulation in cancer affects chromatin structure. I also discovered the partial duplication of ALL1 (MLL1) in AML. I also discovered TCL1, which is responsible for 98% of human pre T cell leukemias, and that this gene is dysregulated in most of the aggressive CLLs. I have also discovered the role of translocations involving the T cell receptor in T cell malignancies. I also generated transgenic and KO mice to validate the oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes we discovered.  It was thought that all cancer genes were encoding protein products. The dogma was that only protein coding genes that represent only 2% of the human genome were important and the remaining 98% was junk. This view was shattered by my discovery in 2002 that CLL is caused by the loss of two microRNA genes on chromosome 13q14, miR-15a and miR-16-1. Thus genes encoding non coding RNAs can also be involved in cancer pathogenesis. We also found that these two microRNAs target BCL2, the gene I discovered in 1984. We also discovered germline and somatic mutations in microRNA genes in human malignancies and that microRNAs are dysregulated in all cancers, primarily because several of them are downstream targets of pathways responsible for oncogenesis. More recently, we discovered that tumors such as lung cancer and pancreatic cancer secrete microvesicles that fuse with macrophages and dendritic cells. MiR-21 that is contained in such microvesicles is internalized, reaches the endosomes of the recipient cells and binds and activates Toll Like Receptor 8 in humans and 7 (it's homologue) in the mouse, activating the receptor. Then NF-?B is activated and IL6 and TNFalpha are secreted, facilitating tumor spreading and metastatic disease. This year we showed that fusion of microvesicles with myoblasts causes cachexia.", ,,,
,9350164,"Rapidly proliferating cancer cells must thrive in a microenvironment wherein metabolic nutrients such as  glucose, oxygen and growth factors become limiting as tumor volume expands beyond the established  vascularity of the tissue. In normal cells, limits in nutrient availability trigger growth arrest and/or apoptosis  thereby preventing cellular expansion under such conditions. The goal of this proposal is to determine the  role of the endoplasmic reticulum stress response/Unfolded Protein Response (UPR) in sensing limitations  in glucose availability and thereby facilitating cellular adaptation. PERK, one of three proximal signal  transducers of the UPR plays a central role in mediating cell fate decisions. The pro-survival function of  PERK has garnered it considerable interest from the point of view of developing small molecule inhibitors of  its catalytic activity and the hope that such inhibitors would have potent anti-tumor activity. Indeed, in the  previous funding cycle, we demonstrated that PERK inhibition is of potential clinical benefit in metastatic  breast cancer. However, because PERK also pro-apoptotic and anti-proliferative activities, it could also  exhibit tumor suppressive activity. Central our ability to effectively target PERK is a complete understanding  of both its anti-proliferative/pro-apoptotic as well as pro-survival functions. In our preliminary work, we  provide evidence that while PERK functions to facilitate melanoma progression, it paradoxically functions as  a potent suppressor of melanoma initiation. In this proposal, we describe three integrated aims that focus  on the elucidation of PERK function in melanoma initiation (Aim 1), the potential efficacy of anti-PERK  targeted therapy (Aim 2) and the identification of tumor-derived PERK mutants and their role in tumor  initiation/progression (Aim 3). These studies will provide critical new insight into the mechanisms whereby  the PERK protein kinase regulates cell homeostasis in response to stress. The aims interface with Projects  1 and 2 through common interests in signaling pathways that sense and respond to metabolic limitation and  through response and regulation of lipid metabolism. The findings steming from work proposed herein will  provide a foundation for the design of novel anti-cancer therpeutics.", ,,,
,9366493,"Two thirds of the 7 million older adults discharged from the hospital annually face new difficulty with activities of daily living (ADLs) that do not resolve by 12 months. To date there has been scant investigation of integrated health and housing interventions to improve physical function. Our proposed trial addresses this scientific gap. It builds upon results from our Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation Challenge grant. The older adults hospitalized in the previous year (N=78) who received the CAPABLE intervention, which combines evidence- based nursing, occupational therapy, and handyman components, reported difficulty with 41% fewer ADLs at 5 month follow-up than baseline. An improvement of this magnitude could make the difference between aging at home independently and needing institutional care. The proposed study will target this vulnerable group to provide new reproducible knowledge about improving physical function after skilled care using a rigorous pragmatic trial design. We propose to test the effectiveness of CAPABLE in older adults for whom recovery time and typical treatment were not sufficient to regain their functional ability. These individuals will be at least 60 days post-hospital discharge, have completed the skilled home health care allowed by Medicare, and still have difficulties with ADLs. We will recruit older (?age 65), principally Latino and African American adults with ? 1 ADL difficulties from the Visiting Nurse Service of New York City Medicare Advantage population. We will interview participants at home and randomize them to either treatment (CAPABLE intervention) or control (usual care). Participants in the treatment group will receive up to 10 in-home sessions - ?6 visits with an occupational therapist and ?4 visits from a nurse ? and ?$1500 in safety and modification services from a licensed handyman. Each treatment participant will receive each intervention component (education, assessment, identification of functional goals, specific strategies tailored to goals and based on protocols). Participants in the usual care group will not receive grant related attention. All participants will be reassessed at 20 and 52 weeks by a research assistant masked to treatment condition. The primary aims of the study are to: 1) test the effectiveness of CAPABLE in reducing the number of ADLs performed with difficulty at 20 weeks post-randomization; and 2) estimate CAPABLE?s economic impact on subsequent health care utilization and costs over 1 year post-randomization compared to CAPABLE program cost. Our secondary aims include: 1) testing CAPABLE effectiveness on ADL function at 52 weeks; 2) testing effects for key subgroups (gender, ethnicity); and 3) examining theoretically-driven mediation pathways for treatment mechanisms. The proposed study would create new knowledge to improve function following hospitalization. Our approach responds to NIA?s strategic goals to understand disability and to improve the health of diverse older populations. Our approach also has timely policy relevance in promoting aging in place in an aging population.", ,,,

The Partnership, located in the heart of the Southeast, a region with a large, historically underserved  African American population, has goals of attaining excellence in research focused on cancer health disparities. The two institutions possess unique strengths that supplement each other. At ASU, which is classified as a historically black college and university (HBCU), more than 90% of students and more than 60% of the faculty belong to an underserved minority community in which health disparities are a significant issue in various areas, including cancer. The UAB CCC, in contrast, has developed an extensive infrastructure and critical mass of scientists that are necessary for a sustained research program. Still, ASU has a cultural sensitivity and perspective that may be deficient in the UAB CCC. Thus, the partners will facilitate collaborations in cancer-related research, training (career development), and education to aid this underserved community. UAB CCC faculty/scientists will cooperate with faculty and students at ASU and thereby initiate cancer research programs, creating an conduit for ASU faculty and students to pursue cancer research programs. The proposed effort will engage underserved groups by providing advanced research in prostate and colorectal cancer (both of which are major cancer health disparities for African Americans), by providing training to students and faculty members and by introducing topics related to cancer health disparities into the undergraduate and graduate curriculum at ASU. The proposed Partnership has an Administrative Core, a Cancer Research Program with two functioning projects, and a Cancer Training and Education Program. Within the Administrative Core, there are Bioethics Support, Biostatistics/Bioinformatics Support, and Evaluation Support. The Partnership will be guided by an Internal Advisory Committee, which will consist of two distinguished scientists of each institution; an Executive Committee with members of both institutions; and, for each organization, a Partnership Institutional Committee. The Cancer Training and Education Program will reach talented students and faculty at ASU, linking them to established investigators and to the research infrastructure at the UAB CCC, and facilitate faculty, graduate, and undergraduate student and education in the area of cancer research in order to increase the number of minority investigators involved in cancer research. The goal of the Bioethics support will be to provide exceptional bioethics education, training, guidance, and consultation throughout the Partnership. The goal of the Biostatistics/Bioinformatics support will be to address the statistical/bioinformatics needs of the research projects sponsored by the Partnership. The specific aims for the Partnership are: (1) to enhance, by development of junior faculty members, the research and administrative infrastructure to conduct competitive basic and community-based cancer research at ASU; (2) to develop investigators committed to research in cancer disparities at both partnering institutions; and (3) to establish a pipeline of minority cancer disparity researchers and health professionals between ASU and UAB.", ,,,
,9398871,"Project Summary/Abstract Alcohol abuse and alcoholism constitute a serious public health concern across the globe. In fact, alcohol is currently the 3rd highest risk factor for disease burden around the world, and its adverse effects influence not only the drinker, but also their families, employers, and communities. Given the immense public health cost of alcohol use and abuse, scientific exchange among international alcohol researchers is critical for addressing important issues in the field and for informing public policy. The International Society for Biomedical Research on Alcoholism (ISBRA) Congress provides an important venue for alcohol researchers from around the world to share scientific findings, discuss and debate issues in the field, and to interact and form scientific collaborations. As the premier international scientific meeting devoted to alcohol research, this Congress brings together a range of basic and clinical scientists that study the biomedical, psychosocial, and clinical aspects of alcohol use, abuse and addiction. The scientific exchange that occurs during the Congress is invaluable for both established and developing research programs around the world. ISBRA Congresses are held biennially and their meeting locations have rotated among Asia/Australia, Europe, and the Americas. This grant requests funding to support travel to the 19th and 20th ISBRA Congresses. The 19th Congress will be held in September 2018 in Kyoto, Japan and the 20th Congress will be held in June 2020 as a joint meeting with the Research Society on Alcoholism (RSA) in New Orleans, LA, USA. In addition, support is being requested for ISBRA members to participate in meetings of ISBRA's affiliate societies, such as the European Society for Biomedical Research on Alcoholism (ESBRA) and the Asian Pacific Society on Alcohol and Addiction Research (APSAAR), which meet biennially in years opposite the ISBRA Congresses. This grant requests partial travel, lodging and registration support for scientists to attend these important Congresses. In particular, this grant seeks to provide support for junior investigators and individuals from underrepresented groups and countries. This support will foster the cadre of young scientists that will develop into the leaders of the field and assist investigators who might otherwise not be able to attend the Congresses. Partial support for Congress publication costs is also requested so the scientific abstracts and summaries can be communicated to the larger research community and the public.", ,,,

MGECF was supported by CoBRE during its  Phase I at which time the facility was in the initial stages of development. By the end of Phase I the facility  was fully functional in creating the mouse models by employing standard mouse embryo manipulation  techniques such as microinjection and transferring into pseudo-pregnant females. During the CoBRE phase  II period the facility has achieved significant accomplishments: i) started offering critical services such as the  design and building of transgenic and targeting vectors that were done previously by the investigators; ii)  initiated many other services such as mouse genotyping and speed congenics; iii) acquired additional  equipment and personnel and provided training to enhance their overall skills (both scientific and  administrative); and iv) initiated research on the most advanced genome engineering methods to validate  them for offering as new services. Notably, the MGECF is among the first three such core facilities in the  nation that started offering'the genome editing service TALENs (Transcription Activator Like Effector  Nucleases). The core almost tripled its user base in 2010 and has maintained it at that level since then. It  has has successfully increased its revenue in the recent three years, becoming less dependent of CoBRE  support and demonstrating its capability to become sustainable in the future. This core facility is one of the  most critical core facilities in the region that serves many investigators across three different institutes.

,9336907,"?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Solid fuels (coal and biomass) are used for cooking and heating by approximately 3 billion people worldwide-- almost all in the developing world. Kerosene is also widely used for cooking and lighting. These fuels emit into the kitchen high concentrations of pollutants, including particulate matter, carbon monoxide and other organic compounds known to affect the eye, such as formaldehyde and naphthalene. Usually, women doing the cooking are the most exposed. There is evidence linking solid fuels to a wide range of health effects, but the impact on eye diseases has not been extensively investigated. Virtually no studies have investigated kerosene use and eye disease. In every part of the world, females are at higher risk of eye disease at all ages. About 90% of visually impaired and blind people lived in developing countries. These two closely related ocular disease studies, which focus on cataract of the lens and age-related macular degeneration (AMD), the first and third most common causes of blindness in the world, and dry eye disease, a major cause of pain and discomfort, take advantage of the established infrastructure, including offices, vehicles and trained field staff, and prior data collection-household cooking, heating and lighting appliance use, and air pollution monitoring data--of an earlier NIH-funded epidemiologic study of TB and indoor fuel use, in Pokhara, Nepal. The ocular disease studies are a cross-sectional study investigating cataract and dry eye disease, and a case-control study investigating AMD.  In the cross-sectional study, women, aged 40-70 years, from TB study households, chosen on the basis of their cooking, heating and lighting appliance use, will be transported to the Manipal Teaching Hospital in Pokhara, where they will receive a free and comprehensive eye examination. Slit-lamp photos of the crystalline lens will be taken and tests done for dry eye disease.  Separately, a case-control study of AMD diagnosed in women attending the hospital will be carried out. Statistical analysis in both studies will focus on examining associations between household fuel uses, for cooking, heating and lighting, and the ocular outcome measures. Together, these will comprise the most comprehensive investigation ever of these potentially causal relationships. Results will have implications for policy and for health interventions. In particular, if evidence is produced that kerosene is a risk factor for eye diseas, then this will strengthen arguments for not treating kerosene as a clean fuel alternative to biomass, as is currently the policy of some international agencies, including WHO. The studies will provide data for reworking cost-benefit analyses of replacing biomass stoves and fuel-based lighting sources with alternatives, such as LPG stoves or electric lighting.", ,,,
,9529991,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cryptosporidium causes life threatening enteric disease in HIV-AIDS patients. Immunocompetent individuals are susceptible, but here symptoms are self-limiting. Cryptosporidium is also well known to cause diarrhea in small children. However, the full impact of Cryptosporidium on child mortality and morbidity was only recently appreciated. After rotavirus, Cryptosporidium is the most common pathogen responsible for severe diarrhea in children under 2 years. The main roadblock to achieving urgently needed advances is the overall poor tractability of Cryptosporidium in the laboratory. The goal of this project is to develop genetic tools for this parasite, and the effort builds on ou recent breakthrough in achieving transfection for C. parvum. Specifically, we will use the assay in hand to iteratively optimize transfection vectors and protocols for Cryptosporidium. We will devise strategies to select and isolate stable transgenic parasites from infected animals, and we will use these tools to establish a reporter model for Cryptosporidium. Such reporter pathogens will immediately open the disease to study and establish robust and quantitative correlates of infection, pathogenesis, drug cure, and immune-protection. In the long term, the ability to modify the parasite's genome will enable fundamental discovery and translate into tools and opportunities to treat and prevent cryptosporidiosis.", ,,,
,9360750,"Project Summary CranioSynOstosis (CSO) is the premature fusion of one or more of cranial sutures that connect individual skull bones for kids. The estimated prevalence of CSO is one in 2500 live births and even higher. Our ultimate goal is to develop an open-source imaging-informatics-platform, eSuture, for clinicians to objectively classify the craniosynostosis using computed tomography (CT) data, and accurately estimate patient-specific spring force for spring-assisted surgery (SAS). CSO is an extremely serious birth defect that involves the premature fusion, of one or more sutures on a baby's skull. CSO, in terms of the fused suture, could be classified mainly into several types of synostosis, such as sagittal, coronal, metopic, and lambdoid. Infants with CSO may have problems with brain and skull growth, resulting in cognitive impairment. This defect may not only ruin the infant's life, but also deeply affect the infant's family. SAS, recognized as a safe, effective, and less invasive treatment method, introduced to treat the CSO. This treatment uses the force of a spring to reshape the skull in a slower manner that harnesses the growth of the skull to assist with shape change. Patient-specific spring selection is the principal barrier to the advancement of SAS for CSO because few surgeons have the experience to select personalized springs for each patient. The selection of the spring force is a crucial step in this surgical treatment, and it is dependent on the experience of the surgeon. Important factors essential in the selection of the spring force include the ages, bone thickness and the subtypes of CSO. One example is that sagittal CSO with an elongated occiput needs a stronger posterior spring, while one with no predominant characteristics typically needs a mid-range anterior and posterior spring. The current problem is that we do not have a complete objective way of classification of CSO and sagittal CSO and estimation of the spring force for the individual. Our hypothesis is that CSO and sagittal CSO can be accurately classified based on the features from sutures and head shape, and behaviors of calvarial bone tissue following virtual optimal spring force can be accurately simulated by integrating a finite element method (FEM) with statistical learning model. To test our hypothesis, we are proposing the following Specific Aim: (1) To define the eSuture Informatic system and build the database, with CT and DTI data; (2) To develop tools for image processing, segmentation, registration, quantification of sutures, and automatically categorize each patient to one catalogue of the CSO types or sagittal CSO subtype; (3) To model and estimate the optimal spring force for SAS; and (4) To validate and evaluate the eSuture system. Our system will produce a paradigm shift in CSO diagnosis and treatment.", ,,,
,9318126,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Spina Bifida clinic standards are not well described or standardized. While multi-disciplinary clinics are considered the standard of care for children with Spina Bifida, evidence to support this model in adults is lacking. Good, seamless health care delivery is important for people with Spina Bifida; however, current systems of care designed to meet the needs of children with Spina Bifida end when a child becomes an adult. Finding good care for adults with Spina Bifida is difficult because of the number of specialists needed, the limited number of practitioners serving this growing population, systems of care that is unprepared to deal with their needs, their growing chronic adult needs, and the lack of knowledge about them. This group is facing a precarious future unless a collaborative approach is initiated to identify their needs and create a health care system that offers uniform, adequate multi-disciplinary care. The creation of the Clinical Care Monitoring and Tracking (CCMT) infrastructure is about looking for problems and needs and about assessing and harnessing the strengths and resources that promote better health and well-being in the Spina Bifida community. Research efforts into the Spina Bifida clinic network resulted in a National Spina Bifida Patient Registry (NSBPR), the compilation of the clinics list, a clinic classification schem, and the creation of the World Congress on Spina Bifida Care and Research. The Spina Bifida Association (SBA) is currently leading the Spina Bifida Collaborative Care Network (SBCCN) in developing a strategic plan to close the health care gaps that have been outlined. The goals of the SBCCN are to identify the needs of people living with Spina Bifida, develop and implement approaches to connect and communicate with adults living with Spina Bifida, address health care needs as well as gaps in care, improve the availability of information on health and community resources, identify and promote research priorities for the NSBPR, develop a quality-based Spina Bifida clinical structure using the (2008) classification scheme, describe and disseminate the list of Spina Bifida care sites that meet the quality-based clinical structure, and develop, implement, and disseminate a comprehensive evaluation plan that measures the effectiveness of the activities of this funding announcement. Expected Outcomes are creation of a public health infrastructure that monitors, tracks, and evaluates Spina Bifida care across the lifespan, development of health outcomes for people with Spina Bifida, and the improvement of a high performing Spina Bifida clinic structure.", ,,,
,9376919,"Project Summary / Abstract Men and women show different incidence and patterns of neurological and psychiatric diseases, indicating that one sex may possess higher levels of factors that protect from disease, or lower levels of factors that exacerbate disease. The long-term goal of the project is to determine which brain regions are influenced by sex-biasing factors such as the genes encoded by the sex chromosomes and the level of gonadal hormones in adulthood. Because these types of sex-biased protection are mediated by different molecular mechanisms, discriminating the sites of action of each factor is the first step towards understanding how sex-biased protection operates. The proposed research involves whole-brain magnetic resonance imaging to measure the size of every brain region, under conditions in which specific sex-biasing factors can be rigorously manipulated to observe their individual effects. The brains of sex chromosome aneuploid and wild-type (XO, XX, XY and XXY) will be compared when mice have or do not have their gonads. The experimental design will determine which sex differences in volumes of brain regions are influenced by the number of X chromosomes, and by the presence / absence of the Y chromosome, and by the levels of testicular and ovarian secretions in adulthood. The results will establish the brain regions and localized functions that are influenced by different sex-biasing mechanisms. The outcome will alter conceptual frameworks for investigating protective mechanisms in brain regions affected by neurological and psychiatric disease.", ,,,

,9330862,"This project focuses on elucidating the function and mechanism of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) in human ocular angiogenesis. Anti-angiogenic therapies using antibodies to vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) have been approved by FDA for cancer treatment and are also the first option of treatment for wet age-related macular degeneration (AMD). However, in many cases, the efficacy of antiangiogenic therapy is still limited, and some patients failed to respond to anti-VEGF treatment. A thorough mechanistic investigation of angiogenesis especially in humans is warranted in order to develop novel and alternative therapeutic approaches. The long- term goal for my laboratory is to decipher the mechanism of noncoding RNAs in ocular vascular development and disease. LncRNAs represent a large group of long (typically >200nt) noncoding RNAs with diverse biological functions, with their roles in angiogenesis still largely unclear. Our genome-wide search has identified a group of human endothelial cell (EC)-enriched lncRNAs. This proposal focuses on a novel primate-specific, EC-enriched lncRNA lncEGFL7OS, which is located in the anti-sense strand of EGFL7/miR-126 gene. Based on our preliminary data and the unique system we recently developed, we test the organizing hypothesis that lncEGFL7OS is required for ocular angiogenesis in humans by regulating the transcription activity of EGFL7/miR- 126. Aim I is to examine the expression and regulation of lncEGFL7OS in ECs.

,9335653,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Multiple Hereditary Exostoses (MHE) is an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by the formation of ectopic cartilage-capped growth plate-like exostoses next to long bones and other skeletal elements. MHE results from mutations in the genes Ext1 or Ext2, which diminish the capacity of cells in the growth plate and the surrounding perichondrium to make heparan sulfate. The mechanism by which a change in heparan sulfate content causes ectopic osteochondromas is unknown, but evidence suggests that the decrease in heparan sulfate affects multiple signaling pathways through which growth factors regulate the organization and proliferation of chondrocytes in the growth plate. Regardless of the mechanism, the primary defect is in the assembly of heparan sulfate, suggesting that restoring the level of heparan sulfate would diminish the frequency of exostoses. All cells make heparan sulfate through a common mechanism. Thus, we propose to use Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells that are functionally hemizygous for Ext1 and to employ a primary cell- based screen to find potential drug candidates that augment heparan sulfate expression. Pilot studies have been done in collaboration with the High Content Screening Core in the Conrad Prebys Center for Chemical Genomics at the Sanford-Burnham Institute. Assay optimization, validation and final implementation of the proposed image-based high-throughput screening assay will be accomplished. The Cheminformatics and Informatics Core at Sanford-Burnham will assist in data analysis, artifact filtering, replicate hit confirmation, and generation of dose response profiles. Secondary assays will test positive hits for their impact on heparan sulfate content and structure. Tertiary assays will measure if the hits modulate heparan sulfate expression in mouse chondrocytes and perichondrial cells and in human chondrocytes. The resultant rank ordering of potency of confirmed hit sets and chemotypes merged with additional secondary and tertiary assay results will aid in hit-to-lead identification. The Cheminformatics Core will search for commercially available analogs to support limited structure-activity profiling. Agents that enhance heparan sulfate synthesis will be evaluated by formulation, stability, pharmacokinetics, and toxicity and their capacity to reduce exostoses in Ext1+/-;Ext2+/- mice. The central hypothesis is that altering key enzymes involved in heparan sulfate metabolism can result in restoration of functionally normal levels of heparan sulfate and reduction of exostoses in mice, which would serve as a proof-of-principle for pharmacological manipulation of exostosis formation in MHE patients.", ,,,
,9336291,"?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Diabetes affects 8.3% of the US population, and lead to costly adverse healthcare outcomes. Unfortunately, there may be a quality gap in the care of complex diabetes patients, that is, older patients (age>65 years) and those with comorbid conditions. Current practices, relying primarily on the presence of several factors, are not effective in capturing the risk of poor prognosis, i.e., multiple hospitalization and/or emergency department visits, and death. Hence, little evidence exists so far to help prioritize care for thes patients. The diabetes guidelines recognize that tight control of glycosylated hemoglobin (A1c) may not be appropriate for complex patients, and recommend individualizations in tight A1c control. However, neither the outcomes of tight A1c control, nor the effects of the typical treatment regimens used to achieve tight A1c control can be evaluated in clinical trials, with minimal, if any, enrollment of complex diabetes patients due to either their restrictive inclusion criteria or lack of encouragement of the patient and/or clinical investigator to consider the RCT. In order to deliver more effective, efficient and accountable health cares, it is important to help clinicians to examine the relationship between patient complexity and patients' A1c control level, and to modify guideline appropriately with an evidence base. The proposed research will analyze a cohort of 8,304 Medicare beneficiaries with diabetes who were cared for by one of the country's 10 largest physician group practices, the University of Wisconsin Medical Foundation during 2003-2011 to address the following aims: (1) to conduct risk prediction incorporating longitudinal outcomes, (2) to inform guidelines for complex diabetes patients, and (3) to create a patient-centered surveillance tool for detecting short-term negative outcomes. Our analytic approach involves the use of state- of-the-art statistics and machine learning methods to take advantage of the large electronic health records data. The proposed methods and results will help clinicians to identify and quantify risks of tight A1c control in complex diabetes patients an potentially lead to improved patient experiences, and reduce medical expenditures from excess adverse events.", ,,,
,9344694,"ABSTRACT: PILOT PROJECTS Despite scientific advances into the pathogenesis of CMT1, CMT2 and CMT4 there are no successful treatments for any of the subtypes that comprise these three groups of inherited neuropathy. In part this is because progression is often slow, sensitive biomarkers to detect disease progression are not yet available, and emerging outcome instruments have not yet been tested in trials. To address these issues we propose three Pilot Projects, two of which are novel and one of which is a continuation of a previous project. Pilot Project 1 will contain two projects. First, in collaboration with the MRC Neuromuscular Centre in London, we will evaluate an MRC funded and developed MRI technique as a potential multicenter biomarker to detect progression in CMT1. Secondly we will evaluate novel quantitative sensory measures as potential biomarkers for CMT1A. These studies will enable us to determine whether MRI and tactile measures can be used as an outcome measure for patients with CMT1A, the most common form of CMT. Results will also serve as a comparison for studies in other forms of CMT. Pilot Project 2 will investigate the potential utility of skin biopsy for CMT. We will perform RT- PCR studies in skin biopsies of CMT1A to correlate changes between the animal models and patients with CMT1A to determine whether biopsies can be used as biomarkers in trials and natural history studies. We will evaluate morphological abnormalities in myelinated dermal nerves from skin biopsies from CMT1A, CMT1B, CMT1X and CMT2A to determine whether there are morphological markers of severity and progression in the four most common genetic subtypes of CMT. Finally, we will generate, grow and freeze down fibroblasts from skin biopsies from CMT patients for assays and for development into immortalized pluripotential stem cells (iPSC). These fibroblasts will be made available to investigators within and outside of the INC RDCRC. Pilot Project 3 is a continuation of Pilot Project 3 from our original funding cycle. It will investigate safety and provide preliminary data to determine the potential effects of a curcumin derivative to slow disease progression in patients with CMT1B. The project will also allow us to evaluate our two recent outcome instruments, CMTPedS and CMTNSv2 in trials with children and adults.", ,,,
,9333384,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Zinc is a metal element that is essential for life, but is toxic when present in excess. Cells therefore rely on mechanisms to maintain a relatively constant intracellular level of zinc despite fluctuations in the extracellular medium. To ensure that zinc levels are maintained at an optimal level for cell metabolism, the expression of genes necessary for zinc transport or zinc storage is often dependent upon cellular zinc levels. Although such changes in gene expression are central to zinc homeostasis, the identity of the factors that sense intracellular zinc levels and mediate these changes is largely unknown. The long-term goal of our research is to understand how eukaryotic cells sense and regulate intracellular zinc levels. To identify proteins that sense zinc, we have taken advantage of the versatile genetics of Schizosaccharomyces pombe. Using this model system we have isolated a novel factor that is required for zinc-dependent regulation of gene expression. This factor, designated Loz1, contains a double C2H2-type zinc finger domain that is essential for zinc-dependent regulation of gene expression. This proposal describes a combined molecular, genetic and biochemical approach to determine how Loz1 is regulated by zinc. Specifically, we will address whether Loz1 directly senses zinc levels, and whether this requires the double C2H2-type zinc finger domain.", ,,,
,9384724,"PROJECT ABSTRACT Nearly one in three Indian adults has hypertension and many more have pre-hypertension. In rural India, roughly three-quarters of adults with hypertension never receive treatment, and 90% of individuals receiving treatment for hypertension fail to achieve adequate blood pressure control. The current Indian public healthcare system is neither oriented nor equipped to process the total caseload of hypertension. This is due in part to poor coordination across facilities at different levels of the healthcare system and lack of mechanisms to efficiently follow-up with or refer patients, resulting in a mismatch between patient needs and treatment availability as well as inefficient use of limited healthcare resources. To address these gaps in the healthcare delivery model, the All India Institute of Medical Sciences, Public Health Foundation of India, and Emory University will partner to develop an Integrated Tracking, Referral, Electronic Decision Support and Care Coordination (I-TREC) package focused on hypertension and its most frequent comorbidity, diabetes. This multi-component package will improve coordination of care across various levels of the healthcare facility hierarchy and will include electronic data capture, electronic decision support, and care coordination training for healthcare professionals; text messaging to patients for appointments and disease management advice; facility level retrieval of patient history and inventory needs; and health administration monitoring of data across levels. Our objectives are to (1) adapt I-TREC for implementation within the public healthcare system with input of local, national, and international stakeholders; (2) implement I-TREC across all 15 health facilities comprising the government healthcare system in Banga Block (sub-district level administrative unit) of Punjab state, India; and (3) evaluate I-TREC using a quasi-experimental design by comparing performance of key indicators in Banga Block with another non-neighboring but comparable block in the same district. The proposed T4 intervention promises to consolidate previously proven strategies at single-levels of the healthcare hierarchy into a coordinated system of care delivery that relies entirely on the existing healthcare workforce. Findings will have the potential to revolutionize care for deadly chronic diseases across India in the most vulnerable and hard-to-reach patients who rely heavily on the government healthcare system and generate a scalable model that can be applied to other similar settings.", ,,,
,9346021,"ABSTRACT  Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a major cause of morbidity and mortality. It is a heterogeneous disease, with  significant epidemiologic and biologic differences depending on the location of the cancer in the colon;  specifically, whether the tumors are right-sided or left-sided. Factors that trigger tumorogenesis or contribute to  differences in outcomes of this malignancy are poorly understood. Epidemiologic data indicate a higher  incidence of right-sided cancers in females, African-Americans, and individuals over 70 years of age, and  possibly a higher mortality for right-sided versus left-sided cancers. Differences are attributable to a number of  genetic and non-genetic factors, including host genetic interactions, social determinants of health, such as  health insurance status and access to screening, diet, and environmental triggers, as well as possible  infectious agents. The detection of infectious agents in CRC tissue is increasingly important to establish  associations and ultimately discover the pathogenic mechanisms behind this malignancy. Recent reports  suggest that viruses, as well as certain bacteria, may be important determinants of CRC. However, the  detection and characterization of viruses in CRC tissues has been hampered by the difficulty in culturing or  isolating viruses by conventional molecular biology methods. In the proposed prospective pilot study, we seek  to conduct comparative metagenomic and metabolomic analyses of healthy (n=50) versus tumorous tissues  (n=50) from patients with right-sided versus left-sided CRC. All samples will be collected from patients  undergoing curative resection at the Department of Surgery of the University of California, San Diego. We will  determine the presence of distinct viral and microbial communities, biofilm layers, and metabolomic profiles in  approximately 15 right-sided and 35 left-sided tumors and in the adjacent normal tissue (negative control).  Comparative analyses between viral and microbial expression, molecular events and tumor location will be  correlated. Metagenomics is a comprehensive technique for surveying microbial species associated with a  disease, and combines the power of deep sequencing genomics, bioinformatics, and systems biology. It has  been used to describe the microbial content of environmental and clinical samples. Preliminary work by  members of our team investigating the CRC microbiome and metabolomic profiles revealed the differential  presence of a microbial biofilm layer with a unique metabolomic profile on significantly more right-sided than  left-sided cancers. Our group has been at the forefront of the development and application of the  metagenomic approaches including the discovery of novel viruses. Combining these techniques with  metabolomics profiling can lead to the discovery of novel viral and metabolic triggers of  carcinogenesis in the colon.", ,,,
,9372020,"Training to Advance Care Through Implementation Science in Cardiac And Lung Illnesses (TACTICAL) is a proposed career development program to dramatically accelerate the pace of implementation science research?and thereby effective delivery of care to patients, beginning with a focus on critically ill patients. TACTICAL proposes to immerse clinician-scientists in a rigorous training program that carefully integrates mentored implementation research practica with a formal curriculum. This will be done under the guidance of a cohesive 15-person multidisciplinary faculty and mentor group drawn from across the University of Michigan. Core faculty are drawn from the Schools of Medicine (Internal Medicine, Learning Health Sciences, Critical Care), Nursing, Business (Finance and Operations Management), Education, Public Policy, and Public Health as well as the Institute for Social Research and the Provost's Office.  This postdoctoral training program will support 5 scholars for 3 years each. This will include a foundation in implementation science and health services research, including theory from psychology, sociology, economics, and operations management; research designs, including statistical analysis, qualitative methods, and randomized evaluations; measurement, including the conduct of surveys, mobile technologies, non-participant observation, focus groups, elicitation of patient perspectives, stakeholder engagement, secondary data, electronic medical records, administrative records, and detailed costing and finance; and comparative effectiveness research using multiple designs. This will be delivered through a structured series of individualized research practica resulting in published papers; formal coursework; and mentored independent research. This will culminate in an application for independent funding as an R01, R21, K08, or K23.  Our vision of success is clear. As part of independent research careers focused on bringing evidence- based best practices to improve critically ill patients' lives, TACTICAL scholars will become independently- funded leaders who both drive change at their own institutions while also developing and evaluating better approaches for driving change nationally and internationally.  In order to achieve this vision, we will draw on 5 basic tenets. First, implementation science demands deep interdisciplinary training. Second, a focus on the complex setting of the intensive care unit (ICU) and the complexity of implementation interventions required there will drive innovation in both ICU care and implementation science itself. Third, we will center their learning in mentored research with full and careful integration of didactics in service of advancing research. Fourth, our training plan builds on modern learning theory, emphasizing that learners master skills more quickly when didactics are tightly coupled to each scholar's own program of research. Fifth, we will build a structure, harnessing cohort and peer effects, that mandates and models productivity while nurturing creativity and tailoring.", ,,,
